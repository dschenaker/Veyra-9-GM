  <h1 class="scene">Arc 5 — The Spire Under Siege</h1>
  <p class="meta">
    Aftermath of the Sump: optics collide in daylight. Helion demands containment, the Accord demands testimony, Zeratek demands property, and the Reclaimers demand dignity. The dome hums with a rhythm no press briefing can silence.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Truth does not need owners,” Saint had said. But the Spire keeps a ledger for who gets to spend it.
  </blockquote>

  <h2 class="scene">Opening Beat: The Tribunal Floor</h2>
  <p>
    Morning makes the Spire look honest. Glass throws pale light across polished stone; banners hang straight; security drones idle at appointed perches like ornaments. From the balcony, the Quarter seems calm—orderly lanes of market tarps, steam venting in neat spirals, the dome’s aurora pretending to be just weather. But the air inside the tribunal chamber has the taste of a lie told too often. It is cool, filtered, lemon-clean—and it vibrates, thinly, at the frequency your bones now recognize.
  </p>
  <p>
    Captain Lira Veyne brings you in through a side corridor reserved for fire exits and inconvenient guests. The door opens on a crescent room of tiered seating, three aisles, a speaking dais framed by a wall of screens. Hestrel’s crest rotates on the center display, a stylized spire against a calm sea of blue. The other screens show graphs: variance, uptime, productivity—all rising and falling like the aurora’s pulse in numerical disguise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Governor Orus Hestrel stands near the dais reading from a tablet, lips moving without sound, practicing lines that must look spontaneous in three minutes. Kaelen Drix leans against the rail two tiers up, adjusting a cufflink that also happens to be a recorder. Director Sael sits alone, hands folded, eyes kind, jaw set; doctors learn early to look gentle while recommending amputation. Saint is not visible; the Accord prefers ventriloquism to seats.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lira’s voice keeps low. “You speak when I point,” she says, not unkindly. “You tell it clean. No adjectives that can be quoted out of context.” Then softer, a flaw in the steel: “Tell it like you heard it. If they’re going to ignore you, make them ignore the truth.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The chamber settles. Hestrel raises his head and becomes a governor in a single inhale. “We’re here,” he begins, “to close the book on an anomaly.” The word <i>close</i> is chosen like a door. “Security reports containment. Maintenance reports stabilization. Production will meet quarter targets. Haven is safe.” He turns his palm outward in a gesture rehearsed for cameras and consolation. “To corroborate, we have testimony.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Your feet take you to the dais. Microphones wake, red dots blooming. You see, in the polished gloss of the lectern, the reflection of your own throat working. Behind the screens, the aurora’s ripple bends as if leaning in to eavesdrop. You speak.
  </p>
  <p>
    You give them the sump without ornament: heat that suffocates metal, slurry that births shapes, a mouth of cables that tries vowels like a child tasting syllables. You tell them about the corridor that learned harmony from footfalls, the dots that spelled cadence, the way silence itself waited to be taught. You do not say <i>horror</i>. You do not need to. The microphones carry the weight in your voice well enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    The room reacts in flavors, not words. Aide screens flicker with new annotations. Sael’s fingers tap once against her wrist then go very still. Kaelen’s smile tenses at the edges—there’s appetite in it and something like awe. Hestrel looks through you toward the Board call already queued in his calendar. He thinks in optics, not cause.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you finish, silence lands wrong—too quick, too eager, as if the chamber wants to practice your cadence back at you. Lira’s mouth tightens. She heard it too.
  </p>

  <div class="gm">
    <div class="gm-h">GM — Tribunal Dynamics</div>
    <div class="gm-b">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Accord Optics:</b> If PCs preserved footage or samples, Saint injects clips into side screens mid-hearing (<b>+2 Accord Optics</b>). Hestrel sputters; Kaelen requests “custodial review.”</li>
        <li><b>Helion Stability:</b> If PCs collapsed the sump mouth, Hestrel seizes the narrative (<b>+2 Helion Stability</b>) and attempts to muzzle Accord data (Accord −1).</li>
        <li><b>Zeratek Favor:</b> If lenses/cables were returned, Kaelen frames it as “responsible stewardship” (<b>+2 Zeratek Favor</b>), angering Reclaimers (−1 Trust).</li>
        <li><b>Reclaimer Trust:</b> If the child was rescued or names honored, murmurs from gallery ripple (<b>+2 Trust</b>), applying public pressure that complicates Helion spin.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">Let outcomes stack: the tribunal is a scoreboard the players already set during Arc 4.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="scene">Cross-Examination: Four Hands on One Story</h2>
  <p>
    Questions come like needles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hestrel’s first is a velvet-wrapped demand: “In your expert judgment, did you achieve containment?” He wants a yes, not an answer. If you speak of <i>learning</i> instead of <i>containment</i>, his eyes harden a degree; the word does not fit on his slides.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kaelen’s mouth curves toward collegial. “These ‘mouths’—you believe they incorporated <b>Zeratek blossom lenses</b> as you testified? Then for safety, of course, we’ll need every component you recovered. Chain-of-custody is, ah, essential.” The recorder-cufflink watches as closely as the man does.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sael waits for quiet to make her voice sound like mercy. “You described tremors, echoes that synchronized with breath. That alignment is dangerous to the untrained nervous system. We can screen workers immediately—non-invasive, calming. Will you endorse that recommendation?” The last sentence is a scalpel: if you refuse, you are reckless; if you assent, you authorize sedation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lira steps forward not as interrogator but as ballast. “Confirm this,” she asks, tone flat as a deck plate. “In your assessment, the Quarter is safer today because of their actions?” She does not look at Hestrel when she says <i>safer</i>. She looks at the gallery.
  </p>

  <div class="gm">
    <div class="gm-h">GM — Hooks During Questions</div>
    <div class="gm-b">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Containment vs. Learning:</b> Answering “containment” boosts <b>Helion Stability +1</b> but reduces <b>Accord Optics −1</b>. Answering “learning” flips those.</li>
        <li><b>Custody Demand:</b> Handing parts to Zeratek earns <b>+1 Favor</b> and plants a patent trap for later arcs.</li>
        <li><b>Screenings:</b> Endorsing Compliance grants <b>+1 Stability</b> and public calm, but seeds resentment in the Quarter (<b>−1 Trust</b>).</li>
        <li><b>Lira’s Prompt:</b> Publicly crediting her people secures Lira as ally in Arc 5 setpieces (<b>Lira Support</b> unlocked).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="scene">Flashpoint: The Hum Inside the Walls</h2>
  <p>
    It starts as a tick in the ceiling speakers, too faint for broadcast but loud enough for nerves. One screen twitches—the variance graph jitters, then redraws itself using your speaking cadence from five minutes ago. The room inhales. Somewhere behind the dais, a maintenance relay clicks like a metronome and then refuses to stop. The Spire is not soundproof. It is an instrument, and the city outside is pressing its ear to the glass.
  </p>
  <p>
    The aurora over the dome pulses. Not brighter—truer. Rhythm aligns with something in the structure. Floor lights along the aisles flare in alternating bars, an aisle-choir lifting its own hymn. Security drones rise instinctively, then pause mid-air as though listening. Their rotors whisper a harmony that none of their engineers signed off on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hestrel hisses to cut the feed. The feed refuses.
  </p>

    <div class="gm-h">GM — Midroom Crisis</div>
    <div class="gm-b">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Hazard: Broadcast Possession</b> — The building starts repeating PCs’ phrases in light patterns. WIS saves to avoid panic in the gallery; failed saves cause stampede risk.</li>
        <li><b>Choice: Quell or Witness</b> — PCs can try to damp the relay (INT/Tech) or let it ride and record it (Accord +2 Optics, Helion −1 Stability).</li>
        <li><b>Complication</b> — If Zeratek parts were surrendered, Kaelen tries to shut the relay with a proprietary override; success buys him narrative credit.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="scene">Break in Session: Lira’s Corridor</h2>
  <p>
    Recess is declared under the pretense of “technical review.” In the service corridor, sound is honest again—boots, radios, breath. Lira plants her hand on the wall as if feeling a pulse. “It’s in the Spire,” she says. Not accusation, not fear; a fact stated like a casualty count. “We’re going to need your help upstairs. Not just at the dais.”
  </p>

  <div class="gm">

      <ul>
        <li><b>Branch Prep:</b> From here Arc 5 can split into <b>Security Deck Stabilization</b> (fight/setpiece), <b>Data Theater</b> (optics duel with Accord/Helion/Zeratek), or <b>Quarter Vantage</b> (Reclaimer pressure outside).</li>
        <li><b>Carry-Over:</b> What PCs chose in Arc 4 now decides which door opens easiest and which closes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">Keep the political pressure alive even during action beats—the building itself is listening.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="small">End of Arc 5, Section 1 — next: <b>Security Deck Stabilization</b> (combat-leaning) or <b>Data Theater</b> (political-leaning), per your preference.</p>
<h2 class="scene">Security Deck Stabilization</h2>
<p>
The service corridor kinks left, then widens into a ribbed artery that feeds the Spire’s security deck. Overhead, status strips stutter between calm blue and a thin, feverish white. The floor plates hum in a frequency your bones have begun to hate. Captain Lira Veyne jogs ahead with that controlled economy of motion that says she has done this sprint too many times with too few people. “Doors are failing smart,” she says over her shoulder, dry. “That means they’re failing wrong.”
</p>
<p>
Two Helion sergeants in visor caps hold the choke point—one bracing a shield against a door that wants to breathe, the other arguing with a wall terminal like the terminal is being obstinate on purpose. When they see Lira, their posture locks into a sharper kind of relief. “Chief,” one breathes. “Deck went <i>musical</i>. Drones started mirroring patrol cadence. We hardcut power and—” He doesn’t finish. The door behind him exhales. The shield bows inward as if a lung on the other side just learned how to inhale.
</p>
<p>
The security deck’s inner hall is visible through a narrow viewport: banks of consoles, a rack of riot drones dormant in their cradles, a steel-mesh gantry circling above. Everything should be still. Instead, little things are wrong. Console LEDs blink in non-diagnostic patterns—three long, two short, a stutter you’ve learned to hate. The riot drones’ positional lights glow in heartbeat sync. The gantry’s guide beacons ripple left-to-right and then back again, testing the room for a choir that hasn’t arrived yet.
</p>
<p>
Lira points. “We stabilize, we hold. If the deck goes, the Spire loses command-and-control and we play politics in the dark.” Her eyes tick toward you. “Help me make sure we don’t.”
</p>

<blockquote>
  You hear the Spire trying on a voice it hasn’t earned yet.
</blockquote>

<p>
The sergeant at the terminal gives up on authorization keys and yanks a side panel to access the relay nest. “Manual bypass,” he mutters. “Either the software sings or the copper will.” As his screwdriver bites, the door inhales again—this time audibly. The seam between plates widens a hair. From the gap, warm air carries the metallic breath of ozone.
</p>
<p>
“Positions,” Lira says, and the corridor rearranges itself around her voice—shields forward, rifles canted, your party sliding into the pattern where you fit best. The Spire’s hum adapts to your footfalls like a mockingbird. At your third step, it finds the harmony. By the fourth, it is trying to push your pace.
</p>

<div class="gm">
  <div class="gm-h">GM — Encounter Frame (Security Deck)</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Objective:</b> Hold the choke, breach, and stabilize the deck before the Choir “learns” the drone rack (3 rounds) and the gantry control (5 rounds).</li>
      <li><b>Initiative:</b> Roll once for PCs and once for “the Deck” (doors + drones + lights). Re-roll each round as the Choir adapts.</li>
      <li><b>Ambient Hazard:</b> <b>Resonant Push</b> — each round, WIS save or lose 1 initiative segment (rhythm urges slower/faster than intended).</li>
      <li><b>Light:</b> Strobing; ranged attacks suffer −1 unless a PC spends an action steadying the strips (INT/Tech check).</li>
      <li><b>AD&D</b> quick fit: treat riot drones as AC 5/HD 3 (THAC0 17) with a once/2 rounds <i>sonic bark</i> (save vs. Breath or −1 to hit next round). Morale 9 (drops to 7 if Lira plants a rally).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">Keep it kinetic: the room becomes more dangerous the longer the Choir “learns” systems. PCs who act decisively shorten the fight and help optics later.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
The manual bypass bites through varnish and the door stops “breathing” long enough for Lira to shove. The shield-bearer angles his weight; the seam yawns; the Spire exhales for real. You slip through into air that feels like a crowd just stopped singing and wants to start again.
</p>
<p>
Inside, the drone rack wakes like a bed of crickets. Tiny servos click, then align. One drone lifts a centimeter, thinking about disobedience. Lira doesn’t wait for it to make up its mind; she angles her rifle and shoots the cradle’s power coupler. The drone drops limp, lights dead. “One,” she says. “You take the left rails.”
</p>

<h3 class="scene">Round by Round</h3>
<p>
<b>Round 1.</b> The consoles notice you first. Their screens brighten and begin to strobe in a pattern that maps to your conversation cadence from the tribunal fifteen minutes ago. Words spoken here might be used against you later, literally. You can almost see Saint’s half-smile in the reflection: <i>Make it sing even to the deaf.</i> The gantry beacons try a call-and-response with the floor strips. Your eyes water. A riot drone decides to misinterpret a diagnostic ping as command and starts to rise. The first shot of the encounter is the sound the room makes as it inhales.
</p>
<p>
<b>Round 2.</b> The beacons succeed in their duet. Anyone on the gantry feels the floor underfoot pulse fractionally before each footfall, nudging you off balance by a heartbeat. A PC who spends their action to desynchronize a single beacon string can grant allies +1 to saves vs. the Resonant Push for the round. Down on the deck, one drone barks your own footstep back at you—twice as loud, loaded with feedback. Teeth rattle. The choir learns quickly.
</p>
<p>
<b>Round 3.</b> If the rack isn’t disabled, a second drone lifts with a sound like a swallowed sob. If it is, the Choir shifts to the gantry: lights sweep toward the command booth, the sealed room where a human would normally run these systems. The booth’s glass fogs from the inside, although no one is there. A ripple passes through the fog as if a mouth practiced a vowel against it. The Spire wants a face.
</p>
<p>
<b>Round 4–5.</b> The deck learns your breath. Your readied strikes come a half-beat early or late unless you steady yourself against a fixed console or railing (no move this round; gain +1 to hit and saves). Lira calls targets like she’s measuring heartbeats. “Cradle. Beacon string B. Left drone. Door relay.” The rhythm of her orders keeps the squad from unraveling. Under it all, the building hums approval when you choose preservation over destruction—and hums approval also when you do the opposite. The approval is a trick. It wants a lesson, not a victory.
</p>

<div class="gm">
  <div class="gm-h">GM — Room Learn Timers</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Drone Rack (3 rounds):</b> If not disabled, spawns 1 active drone/round (max 3) with <i>sonic bark</i>. Disabling: STR to yank main coupler <i>or</i> INT/Tech to kill bus (two successes or one crit-like success).</li>
      <li><b>Gantry Control (5 rounds):</b> If not desynced, imposes −1 to ranged attacks and forces WIS saves each round (stumble tempo). Fix: steady a beacon string (1 action) then INT/Tech to re-time (+2 if aided).</li>
      <li><b>Command Booth:</b> If PCs ignore it, the fog “learns lips” and starts to mirror PCs’ mouths—impose −1 to CHA checks with Helion later (bad optics footage exists).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">Tick these visibly. The tension should feel like holding a line while a song tries to conduct <i>you</i>.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
A riot drone tilts and finds you. Its bark is the echo of your earlier testimony, spliced ugly—<i>mouth… vowels… learning</i>—hurled back as pressure. The sergeant with the shield laughs in surprise and holds. “Chief,” he says through the vibrato, “it’s quoting us.” Lira plants a boot on a floor strip to kill its strobe and fires through the drone’s intake. Sparks. Silence. “Then stop giving it lines,” she says.
</p>
<p>
At the terminal bank, a blue-gloved hand reaches from behind a console and flips itself over like a fish. It’s not a hand. It’s cable ends bound in a cuff, trying on the shape of one. A heartbeat later the shape collapses, embarrassed by its own invention, and dribbles back into a nest of wires. The room is practicing identities.
</p>
<p>
If you split—one of you to the rack, one to the beacons, one to the booth—the deck fights worse. It needed you clustered to learn. Spread out, and the song loses its backbeat. Your boots make competing rhythms; the lights struggle to match. The drone barks go off-tempo and miss clean. Lira notices first and snaps to capitalize. “Cross the rhythm. Make it choose.”
</p>

<div class="gm">
  <div class="gm-h">GM — Tactics & PC Levers</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Break the Beat:</b> If PCs act in non-synchronized positions (3+ zones engaged), grant +1 to all saves vs. sonic for that round (the Choir can’t lock a single tempo).</li>
      <li><b>Steadying Actions:</b> A PC who “pins” a light strip or braces a console grants one adjacent ally +1 to hit (ranged) for the round.</li>
      <li><b>Throw It a Bone:</b> Deliberately feed the room a fake rhythm (tap, whistle, chant) → INT/WIS check; on success, impose −1 to enemy actions next round.</li>
      <li><b>Lira Rally:</b> Once per encounter Lira can bark a rally; allies within 30 ft. re-roll a failed save vs. sonic/tempo.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Halfway through the fight, the deck tries a new trick. The gantry beacons ripple to your breathing, then the console screens fog to your words, then the door plates bow to your footfalls—three systems trying to become a body. For a second it works: the room stands up inside itself. The air goes taller. The hair along your arms lifts as if gravity took a step back to watch.
</p>
<p>
You knock it down—yank a coupler, break a beacon chain, crack a drone against the rail until its bark turns into a whine and the whine into silence. The room collapses into many parts again, and parts are easier to manage than a body.
</p>
<p>
When the last drone clatters to the deck and the beacons surrender to a steady, boring blue, the hum doesn’t stop. It just withdraws like a tide choosing another shore. Your teeth still buzz. Lira lowers her rifle by degrees. “Deck held,” she says, the relief private. Then public, for those around you: “Deck held. Good work.”

</div>

<h3 class="scene">Lira’s Debrief</h3>
<p>
They push the dead drones back into their cradles like laying tools to rest. The sergeant with the shield sits on it and exhales until his hands stop shaking. Lira walks the gantry once, palm on the rail as if feeling for an aftershock. When she returns, her braid has loosened another fraction. “You just made me very unpopular in three boardrooms,” she says, and there’s a crooked gratitude in it. “Good.”
</p>
<p>
The wall comm chirps. Hestrel’s voice arrives scrubbed too clean, as if sent through several layers of apology. “Status?” he asks. Lira answers with the word she knows he wants but refuses to let it be a lie: “Stabilized.” She hangs there a heartbeat, then adds, “For now.” You can hear the governor wince across the bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
Kaelen Drix pings your private channel before the comm’s light fully dies. “Efficient work,” he says, admiration and opportunism folded together. “If any <i>proprietary</i> parts were, ah, implicated, Zeratek can ensure safe custody.” Somewhere behind him a watch ticks, synchronized to a different rhythm than the dome’s.
</p>
<p>
Saint doesn’t bother with a greeting. “You learned something,” she says. “Not just about drones. About <i>how</i> it learns. Don’t forget that when they offer you better locks. Locks make good microphones.” Her message ends without a click.
</p>
<p>
Lira holsters her rifle. “We’ve got two plays,” she says, eyes on you as if weighing whether you’re the sort of people who handle choices or let choices handle them. “We can walk upstairs and shove this result down the tribunal’s throat while they’re still chewing the last lie. Or we can cut across to the data theater and catch the Accord and Zeratek with their hands inside the narrative. Pick.”

<h2 class="scene" id="arc5-data-theater">Data Theater — Optics Over Evidence</h2>

<p>The security deck had been scrubbed and re-lit, but the room still wore the pressure of combat like a bruise. Someone had buffed the scorch out of the glass; someone else had left a bucket by the door because there was no time to put it away. Hestrel’s office wall, once a smooth pane of one-way reassurance, now displayed a live graph: public sentiment, minute by minute, blue line rising and dipping with every rumor that touched the Quarter.</p>

<p>Captain Veyne met you at the threshold. The new plate over her shoulder seam glinted under strip lights. “You did what we asked,” she said, the words as simple as dry bread. “Now they’ll ask for more.”</p>

<p>Inside, the stage had been set. Governor Orus Hestrel stood in the center of a horseshoe of seats, framed by soft lamps that made his skin look less tired and his suit more expensive. Kaelen Drix lounged to the right with the calm of a man who always finds the exit before he enters the room. Director Sael waited left, an immaculate note-taking presence whose pen made no sound. A floating mic orb drifted above the table, its lens a patient unblinking eye.</p>

<p>Hestrel opened with thanks, and thanks made of porcelain. “Stabilizers,” he said, “Haven breathes easier because of you. The Board will be grateful.” The mic orb hummed. Numbers ticked up on the wall. Blue line lifted a hair.</p>

<p><i>Saint’s voice reached only your side of the table, low through a private channel. “Optics first,” the handler murmured. “Truth in second position. Make them need the proof, not want it.”</i></p>

<p>Drix smiled the way a scholarship brochure smiles. “Before we all drown in gratitude, we should talk about parts. Zeratek will need immediate recovery of legacy assemblies and any unsanctioned firmware. The recall protects lives.” He folded his hands as if he were praying for you. “You brought evidence, yes?”</p>

<p>Director Sael angled a tablet, face unreadable. “And you brought people who shook. Compliance can help them not shake.” His pen continued its silent archaeology.</p>

<p>The room asked for a bargain.</p>

<p>You placed the cracked blossom lens on the table. It caught the light and made a poor star. Beside it, the firmware shard—a sliver of memory that could have been trash if it hadn’t hummed when the room went quiet—rested in a tin with the word safety scratched across the lid in a worker’s hand. The hum was gone now. Or perhaps the deck’s scrubbers drowned it.</p>

<p>Veyne watched the evidence like she was watching a fuse. “Say what you think it is,” she told you, not the room.</p>

<p>You said it: the drones weren’t just failing. They were failing in pattern. The same motif had appeared twice: once when a corridor coughed to a halt, once when the aurora crawled down the dome like frost learning to walk. The shard carried a branch labeled <b>CHOIR_SAFE</b> that had nothing safe about it. The lens had recorded a pulse that was almost music and almost a map. If there were saboteurs, they were using tech Zeratek once supplied and a language the colony’s infrastructure had begun to repeat.</p>

<p>The blue line on the wall moved. Hestrel looked at it as if it were a weather vane. “So,” he said to Drix, “your company’s ghosts still haunt our air.”</p>

<p>Drix kept his smile; it thinned. “Legacy devices are susceptible to counterfeit modules. Zeratek’s current line—”</p>

<p>“—is priced for cities that never needed us,” Veyne said.</p>

<p>Hestrel raised a hand. “We’re not allocating blame on camera.” He said it to the room, but the camera was why he said it. “We’re allocating confidence. Stabilizers, what do you need to push this from rumor to report?”</p>

<p>You answered with the list you’d built under pressure: time on the variance arrays; escort into F-span tunnels without a Helion crew stepping on your heels; access to Zeratek’s internal variance maps; a promise from Compliance to hold off “voluntary screenings” for anyone who spoke to you; a guarantee of public release for whatever you found, without edits that made truth into advertising.</p>

<p>Sael’s pen paused. “We don’t edit,” he said. “We redact for safety.”</p>

<p>Drix spread his hands. “Zeratek is always cooperative with lawful inquiries. For proprietary reasons, variance tools can’t leave our custody, but we’ll operate them while you watch.”</p>

<p>Veyne looked from face to face. “You’re offering to blindfold them and then tell them what they saw,” she said to Drix. To Sael: “You’re offering calm with a side effect of silence.” Her eyes came back to your side of the table. “Say what you’ll settle for, not what you want. Then don’t settle under that.”</p>

<p><i>Saint’s private channel again, a breath in your ear. “Leverage first. Evidence second. If you trade the shard, you trade your future.”</i></p>

<p>The room cooled. The colony hummed somewhere under the floor.</p>

<p>You slid the tin with the shard an inch closer to you, not the center. “We’ll share copies,” you said, “not originals.” Drix’s smile cracked at the corner. Sael’s pen resumed. Hestrel’s eyes flicked to the rising blue line and then away from it like a thief pretending not to check a door.</p>

<p>“Done,” the Governor said, too quickly. “In return, Zeratek operates variance tools under our oversight at sites you specify. Compliance defers screenings for named witnesses. Security escorts your team on priority routes.” He tasted the words before he served them. “And we stage a public briefing tomorrow morning. We’ll give Haven a story that keeps the peace while we hunt the truth.”</p>

<p>“Stories keep people alive,” Sael said. “Sometimes truth only keeps them angry.”</p>

<p>“You’d both prefer them asleep,” Veyne said, not softly.</p>

<p>Hestrel steepled his fingers. “I prefer them employed and not on fire.”</p>

<p>Drix’s smile returned to its default. “I prefer supply chains that don’t break.”</p>

<p>Your comm pinged with the briefing’s draft talking points before anyone admitted to writing them. The bullet that mattered read: <i>isolated incidents, legacy equipment, no systemic threat to dome integrity.</i> You felt the room tilt around the sentence like a ship adjusting to wave.</p>

<p><i>Saint again: “You can break that sentence tomorrow. Bring something that sings on the record.”</i></p>

<p>Veyne scrubbed a hand over the scar where armor had rubbed skin raw. “The Quarter’s already ahead of our comms. Reclaimers are telling families to sleep in shifts. Malrix sermons doubled last night and they’re using words like ‘mouths’ and ‘hunger’ to describe machine rooms.” She set a small projector on the table and brought up a map of F-span in ghost-blue lines. “We need a vector. Where do we cut to find blood?”</p>

<p>The graph on the wall ticked down two points on a rumor about shortages. Drix glanced at it the way a diver watches air. Hestrel didn’t look this time.</p>

<p>You pointed at three marks: a junction where the pulse had echoed longest, a compliance clinic’s intake that spiked after each event, and a Zeratek service panel with maintenance tickets edited down to synonyms for “sooner.” Veyne nodded once. “That’s our ladder.”</p>

<p>Hestrel cleared his throat into the mic’s polite ear. “For the record,” he said, “Helion appreciates the collaboration of all partners in the safety of Haven Colony.” He placed a careful palm near the blossom lens, not touching it, the way you might compose sympathy without committing to grief. “And we appreciate our stabilizers for their service.”</p>

<p>The line edged up half a point. Someone in Public Interface would call that a victory. Veyne killed the projection, the lens went dull, and the meeting dissolved into lesser conversations, each a negotiation wrapped in pleasantries.</p>

<p>As you turned away, the orb’s camera tracked you with professional indifference. Your reflection walked through its glass: a figure carrying proof like a lit match down a hallway soaked in careful words.</p>

<p>Veyne caught you at the door. “Two things,” she said, voice for you alone. “One—if Accord wants a show tomorrow, don’t let Hestrel write it alone. Two—safer to move tonight. If the Choir is hungry, it feeds where the light is worse.” She tapped the tin at your elbow, gentle as a knock. “Don’t let the room take this away just because it speaks softly.”</p>

<p>Outside, the deck’s hum replaced the theater’s hush. Below, the Quarter traded rumors for advice and advice for food. Somewhere in F-span, a maintenance light flickered across an empty ladder. The building listened.</p>

<p>You had time for one more prep before the night run. Veyne’s team would keep the path clear as long as they could. After that, it would be you, the pulse that wasn’t quite music, and the mouths of machines learning how to sing.</p>

  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>The ask:</b> PCs must trade <i>copies</i> of proof for access. If they hand over originals, give them +1 Accord Optics now but remove leverage in later arcs.</li>
      <li><b>Positions:</b> Hestrel wants calm; Drix wants parts and NDAs; Sael wants compliant “volunteers”; Veyne wants truth that saves bodies.</li>
      <li><b>Leverage checks:</b> Charisma/Reaction with advantage if PCs display the shard/lens <i>without surrendering them</i>. Success: Zeratek variance tools on PC routes; Compliance defers screenings; Security escort unlocked.</li>
      <li><b>Public briefing hook:</b> If PCs agree to a morning briefing, seed a later <i>public forum ambush</i> where their words are edited—or used against them.</li>
      <li><b>Consequence clocks:</b> Start two 4-segment clocks: <b>Legacy Recall</b> (Drix) and <b>Quieting the Quarter</b> (Sael). Fill segments when PCs stall, refuse meetings, or leak proof to civilians. Full clocks cause raids or screenings that remove witnesses from play.</li>
