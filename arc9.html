  <p>
    The overlook held a thin wind that couldn’t be from outside, yet tasted of night. Below, the Factory’s lines ran in obedient geometry, light pulsing like a measured breath. Behind you, the crawlspace hatch clicked as if counting—one, two, three—waiting for you to become another rhythm. You carried proof that could end jobs, or save lives, or both, depending on the room in which it was read aloud.

  <!-- SCENE 1 -->
  <h2 class="scene" id="a9-s1">Scene 1 — The Stair That Chooses You</h2>
<blockquote><i>“Truth arrives late to meetings but ruins the agenda.”</i> — Saint</blockquote>

<p>
Exfiltration should have been simple: retrace the crawl, duck through service doors, climb the
same stairs down which the Factory had swallowed you. Instead, the building rearranged itself with
the patient cruelty of bureaucracy. When you reached the first junction, three new exits stood
waiting, none of them where they had been, each one lit in a different register of kindness.
</p>

<p>
The <b>north stair</b> carried the honest gray of municipal paint, the kind used on walls of hospitals
and civic centers. The smell rising from it was faintly of old coffee and wax, like morning meetings
no one wanted to attend. Fluorescent lights buzzed without flicker, but the hum beneath them was not
electrical—it was rhythmic, almost like a heartbeat pacing your steps in advance. Somewhere far
above, you could swear you heard the shuffle of shoes, as if an audience waited already.
</p>

<p>
The <b>east lift</b> was a mouth of brushed steel, wide doors lit by a wellness-blue strip. A pleasant
chime sounded as you drew close, melodic and almost reassuring. Its screen scrolled slogans in
corporate font: <i>Wellness is Productivity. Your Safety is Our Outcome.</i> The letters lingered too
long, as though aware they were lying. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and lavender, a staged
comfort that made the hairs on your arms lift. The lift whispered speed, but also surveillance.
</p>

<p>
The <b>service ramp south</b> bore yellow hazard chevrons faded by years of traffic. It sloped into
shadow, grease streaking the walls, the smell of coolant and fried circuitry drifting upward. The
silence there was not absence, but secrecy: the kind of quiet where people whispered names of the
dead and believed the walls kept confidence. On the edge of hearing, you caught a faint, childish
<i>ta-ta-ta</i>, like a game being played in ducts too small for adults. Ren froze when he heard it. He
pressed fingers to his throat and looked at you, eyes wet and furious, as if daring you to pretend
you hadn’t noticed.
</p>

<p>
Tala shifted her lamp beam between the three choices, her face hard with calculation. “The Factory
isn’t showing exits,” she muttered. “It’s showing <i>judgments</i>.” She clicked the lamp off for a
second. In the dark, the hums and scents grew louder, clearer, as if competing for your consent. When
she clicked it back on, she added, “Whatever you choose, it’ll write itself in the record. Someone’s
keeping the minutes.”
</p>

<p>
Each step of choice felt heavier than the last. Even breathing seemed to set off echoes: when you
inhaled, the lights of the north stair flared. When you exhaled, the lift’s chime ticked softly, as
if congratulating you. The ramp whispered nothing, and its silence was more demanding than the other
two’s invitations.
</p>

<div class="gm collapsible open">
  <div class="gm-h">GM — Exit Fork</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>North Stair (Helion Optics):</b> Clean route through monitored areas. Easy Stealth now, harder spin later. Helion Stability +1 if used (they “escorted” you out on camera). Gain access to Spire lobby without alarms.</li>
      <li><b>East Lift (Compliance Shadow):</b> Fast but flagged. Save vs. Spells to resist lull from “wellness” chime; failure = −2 to first reaction roll in Scene 2. Compliance Control +1 on use.</li>
      <li><b>South Ramp (Accord Street):</b> Dirtier route through service bays and Graywater alleys. More checks now; better optics for Accord if you emerge with workers. Reclaimer Trust +1 on success, +2 if Ren accompanies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small"><b>Note:</b> If Audit Window ≤ 1h, trigger a roving <i>Internal Sweep</i> (2 drones + 1 Compliance pair) on the first failed Move Silently/Hiding roll regardless of route.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Ren tugged at your sleeve. He pointed first toward the stair, then toward his chest, shaking his
head—he would not survive more optics. He pointed at the lift, then made a sign of sleep, his jaw
tight with warning. Finally he pointed at the ramp, then at the ground, fingers splaying wide to
mean <i>roots</i>, <i>home</i>. His silence spoke louder than the three exits combined.
</p>

<p>
Tala met your eyes. “We can’t stand here long. The building counts us every breath. Sooner or later
it’ll notice the math doesn’t add up. And then it’ll adjust.” The lamp flickered once as if to prove
her point.
</p>

<p>
Whichever choice you made, the Factory rearranged itself to accept it. The stair hummed louder, the
lift’s chime sharpened, the ramp exhaled heat like a furnace’s sigh. Even before your foot touched
the first step, you knew the path wasn’t an exit at all—it was testimony, recorded by walls that had
learned to sing.
</p>

  <!-- SCENE 2 -->
  <h2 class="scene" id="a9-s2">Scene 2 — Who Gets the Truth</h2>
  <blockquote>“Testimony is a weapon that breaks in the hand that lies.” — Reclaimer proverb</blockquote>

  <p>
    Haven’s corridors remembered you faster on the way out. Doors pre-opened by a quarter, cameras panned politely away, and the floor stopped reminding you about safety. Outside the Factory’s last security threshold, night had pooled against the dome, aurora seaming the sky with green-white stitches. Sirens tested themselves and quit, deciding that whatever was coming would be better met with an even expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three paths waited and none were secret. The Spire’s lobby was lit to flatter men who have statements to make. The Accord office two tiers down wore anonymity like a badge. Graywater’s Market Quarter burned with low lamps and the smell of things fried fast to hide their age. The proof in your pack rearranged its weight depending on where you looked.
  </p>

  <div class="gm collapsible open">
    <div class="gm-h">GM — Delivery Fork & Consequences</div>
    <div class="gm-b">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Deliver to Helion (Spire lobby):</b> Hestrel receives with cameras rolling. If you bring sanitized proof (no Choir language), gain Helion Stability +2, Accord Optics −1. If you include “your mouths are ours” stills, Hestrel attempts containment: Compliance Control +1, but you gain leverage for later (blackfile).</li>
        <li><b>Deliver to the Accord (Saint):</b> +2 Accord Optics (+3 if Ren present). Helion Stability −1. Saint asks for immediate publishing; refusal banks a Favor token.</li>
        <li><b>Deliver to the Street (Reclaimers/Graywater):</b> Reclaimer Trust +2; Accord Optics +1; Helion Stability −2 if the crowd chants the phrase. Crowd scene risks escalation: on failed CHA check, trigger “Orderly Dispersal” (nonlethal sweep) that can turn ugly.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ren’s Fate:</b> Escorting him to Spire → he is sidelined by “care protocols” (Compliance Control +1 unless contested). To Accord → becomes living testimony (+1 Accord Optics). To Street → protected but hunted (later hook).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    In the Spire, Governor Orus Hestrel stood in a frame that had been measured for him in advance. He wore a suit the color of outcomes and a tie the color of patience. Cameras nested discreetly in planters, the way birds do when they trust a place will not be shaken. “You look tired,” he said, which meant <i>you look useful</i>. Lira stood behind him, helmet under arm, braid severe, eyes taking the room’s pulse. When your pack shifted, both of them noticed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Accord’s office, Saint didn’t sit. She let the room remain unbalanced, so promises had to find their footing. “What did they make you sing?” she asked softly, like a doctor who knows the answer and needs to hear you say it anyway. When you laid out proof, she arranged it without touching it, making headlines out of objects with the distance of someone who has mourned sources in private.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Graywater, Serin Vael stood on a pallet and spoke like a torch that had learned grammar. Rust Varo flanked her, the set of his shoulders making promises about what would and would not be allowed to happen to those who had already lost too much. When you held up the film, the crowd went quiet in the way crowds do right before they decide how history will remember them.
  </p>

  <!-- SCENE 3 -->
  <h2 class="scene" id="a9-s3">Scene 3 — The Choir’s Invitation</h2>
  <blockquote><i>“If a song learns you, learn it back.”</i> — Graywater saying, origin disputed</blockquote>

  <p>
    You expected pursuit. Instead, you received an invitation. It arrived as a softening of lights above the Market Quarter, as if the dome had decided to dim for a performance. The hum that followed found your ribs and asked to be let in. Every screen in the tier blinked the same sentence in clean corporate font: <i>REMEMBER TO BREATHE</i>. Then a second line jittered into being beneath it, made of stray characters that wanted to be letters: <i>we are already breathing for you</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Drones gathered not in formation but in attention, lenses dilating like eyes during a story. The Choir did not speak. It made the city sing itself, one frequency at a time—vent shafts, lift cables, the fine wires in LED strings—until the air carried a chord that wasn’t loud so much as inarguable. You felt the dampener on your hip reach for strength it didn’t have. It thrummed with a loyal dog’s determination and then settled for dying bravely if asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lira’s voice cut through with the authority of a siren that has decided to be human. “Eyes front. If you feel it in your teeth, bite down. If you hear your name, it isn’t yours right now.” Hestrel smiled the way men smile when they are using a smaller truth to shelter a larger one. Saint’s mouth didn’t change shape, but you could tell she was counting headlines and casualties on adjacent abacuses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The invitation unfolded into choice. The Choir’s chord tilted toward the Factory, like a hand offering to pull. In the Spire, a bank of screens brought up the <i>Variance Process Control</i> dashboard with a permissions prompt timed to your heartbeat. In the Market, the hum synchronized to footsteps, promising that if everyone walked together the street would open like water. It wanted to see if you would let it help.
  </p>

  <div class="gm collapsible open">
    <div class="gm-h">GM — Finale Fork (Phase I end-state)</div>
    <div class="gm-b">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Resist the Invitation:</b> Party steels themselves (group Save vs. Spells; advantage if dampener active). Success → the chord fractures; Helion must respond in human terms (public forum or crackdown; pick based on earlier clocks). Accord Optics +1 for visible resistance.</li>
        <li><b>Use the Invitation:</b> Let the Choir “carry” you—reduced immediate danger, but mark PCs with a subtle resonance (−1 vs. future Choir saves until cleansed). Gain footage of the chord’s organized behavior (Accord +2). Compliance Control +1 aftereffects (“unsanctioned exposure”).</li>
        <li><b>Turn the Invitation:</b> With Ren/Serin/Lira help, redirect the chord into the Spire’s lobby systems; force a live forum. CHA/INT checks to keep it civil: success → public testimony scene (Helion Stability −2, Accord +2, Reclaimer +1). Failure → tense crowd control setpiece, no fatalities if handled, reputational fallout varies.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The decision wrote itself into your muscles before it reached your mouth. Ren’s hand closed on your sleeve with the pressure of someone who has learned the price of being left for later. Hestrel lifted his chin to meet a camera he could not see and began a sentence whose first clause was apology and whose last clause was math. Saint’s eyes found yours and held them still, the way you hold a compass when the ship rolls.
  </p>
  <p>
    You moved. The chord followed. Haven tilted slightly toward a future that would remember this night as the last time silence was an option.
  </p>
