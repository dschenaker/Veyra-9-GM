  <h1 class="scene">Arc 1 — Miners’ Desperation (Continuous Chapter)</h1>
  <p class="meta">Mandate: the Obsidian Accord inserts the party as deniable stabilizers. Sponsors circling: <b>Helion</b> (Governor Orus Hestrel, Capt. Lira Veyne), <b>Zeratek</b> (Kaelen Drix), the <b>Accord</b> (Saint), <b>Reclaimers</b> (Serin Vael, Rust Varo), <b>Compliance Medicine</b> (Director Sael). Something new and wrong moves in the electrics—miners call it <b>the Choir</b> and don’t say it twice.</p>

  <blockquote><em>“You are to keep Haven alive without embarrassing anyone wealthy enough to own a share of it.”</em> — Saint</blockquote>

  <h2 class="scene">Arrival at Haven</h2>

<p>The shuttle’s belly caught the docking clamps with a metallic shriek that traveled up through your boots, a sound halfway between a scream and a sigh. It was the sort of sound that warned you a city like Haven was built more on desperation than engineering. Frost burst into white ferns across the viewport as atmospheric seals flexed. Beyond the glass stretched the dome—an immense bubble of polymer and alloy that should have glowed steady, but instead flickered with green-white auroral threads. They stitched and unstitched like a wound that couldn’t decide whether to close.</p>

<p>The city underneath the dome looked like patchwork held together with nerves. Modular blocks pressed against scaffolding, scaffolding welded to older scaffolds, layers upon layers of construction that looked less like a blueprint and more like a scar that never healed clean. Lights sputtered along walkways, and every time one guttered you could swear the whole dome dipped its breath. It was a city that had been rebuilt more times than it had ever been finished.</p>

<p>Inside the cabin, the recycled air reeked faintly of ozone, sweat, and sealant. A voice on the shuttle’s comm—a woman from Helion Industries PR—repeated a brittle welcome. <em>“Haven: your frontier home. Built with courage. Sustained by unity.”</em> The message hiccuped midway through, and the last word repeated twice before the system cut the feed. Unity, unity.</p>

<p>Security teams waited at the hazard-red line where docking gave way to clean floor. They formed a crescent wall: visors down, rifles slung but unlocked, boots polished though the plating beneath them was scuffed. Their posture wasn’t menace—it was exhaustion tautened into readiness, the sort of soldiers who could drop into violence without lifting their heartbeat. Civilians gathered behind them, craning necks to glimpse the new arrivals, whispering like the presence of outsiders might reset the odds.</p>

<p>Captain Lira Veyne stood at their center, helmet tucked beneath one arm. Her uniform was pressed as if wrinkles were a personal insult. Her braid lay pinned flat and exact, the way a surveyor pins lines on a map. She didn’t scan the group of you like a commander inspecting troops. She measured, quietly, like a mechanic deciding which tools would last and which would break under pressure.</p>

<blockquote>“Three fires,” she said, her voice sharp but weary. “One extinguisher. Production has stalled. The Quarter bleeds. If the miners can’t go home and come back again, Haven dies before the week is out.”</blockquote>

<p>The aurora above the dome spat a sudden flare, and for an instant every face reflected ghost-light. The civilians twitched at it but pretended not to notice. The Security line didn’t even blink. Lira Veyne let the silence stretch, measuring how long it would take you to fill it. That, too, was a test.</p>

<p>Behind her, a pair of Helion banners hung limp. They bore the corporate seal—an eight-pointed flare over a stylized dome. The edges were frayed, and someone had sewn over a tear with crude black stitches. Nothing in Haven escaped patching.</p>

<p>One of the civilians in the crowd muttered something about <em>“Accord fixers,”</em> and the rest turned their eyes on you—some with hope, others with contempt. Hope that you could relieve the pressure in the Quarter. Contempt because outsiders always came with promises that didn’t fit the shape of the colony’s wounds.</p>

<p>Lira raised a hand. The murmuring died. “You’re with me to the Quarter,” she said. “The other fires wait their turn.”</p>

<div class="gm">
  <div class="gm-h">GM — Roleplay Notes (Arrival)</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Atmosphere:</b> Stress the <i>fragility</i> of Haven. The dome flickers, scaffolds creak, the PR messages glitch. Make the PCs feel they’ve stepped into a city that survives on habit, not stability.</li>
      <li><b>NPC reactions:</b> Civilians treat PCs as both saviors and liabilities. Roll 1d4: (1–2 hopeful, 3 suspicious, 4 contemptuous).</li>
      <li><b>Lira’s test:</b> She’s not giving a choice. She’s weighing if the party wastes words or commits quickly. If PCs stall, mark <i>Accord Optics −1</i>. If they step forward decisively, grant <i>+50 XP</i> for “reading the room.”</li>
      <li><b>Foreshadowing:</b> The aurora’s flicker should feel unnatural—drop subtle hints that its rhythm isn’t random.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As the party steps off the shuttle, the crowd’s whispers rise again. Words like <em>“rations,”</em> <em>“strikes,”</em> and <em>“lost rigs”</em> thread the air. A child on someone’s shoulders points at the shuttle and asks, too loudly, <em>“Are they the ones who make the drones stop singing?”</em> His parent hushes him, but the phrase hangs there, connecting the static hum of the aurora with something far more immediate.</p>

<p>Lira Veyne ignores the question, but the way her jaw tightens is an answer in itself.</p>
<h2 class="scene">Captain Lira Veyne</h2>

<p>Captain Lira Veyne was not the kind of officer Helion’s corporate brochures imagined for their frontier colonies. The pamphlets painted Security Chiefs as shining examples of discipline, smiling in staged photos with polished rifles and scrubbed armor. Lira carried none of that shine. She wore her helmet tucked beneath one arm not for show but because she had been walking the Quarter herself, counting ration bracelets and pacing out the distance between where guards stood and where civilians dared gather. Her braid was pinned tight not to impress but because loose hair in a brawl gave enemies something to grab. She looked at people and saw uses, limits, and breaking points before she ever asked for a name.</p>

<p>Still, Helion used her face in reports. Every time the Board called for an update on Haven, her image appeared on-screen—stoic, crisp, and silent. They presented her as the embodiment of stability, proof that the colony was under control. What the Board never asked, and what Lira never offered, was that the silence in her photo was not approval but fatigue. She had held lines before—on Bryndor’s water flotillas, on Kharsis’s storm caravans, in skirmishes where desert raiders taught her how few bullets it took to decide a town’s fate. She knew what a line cost, and how it frayed when executives demanded optics before outcomes.</p>

<p>To the party, she did not offer charm or warmth. She offered the blunt fact of her presence. When she said, “Three fires. One extinguisher,” she was not dramatizing. She was telling you what you had walked into: a city with more crises than bodies to answer them. Her eyes, gray and restless, lingered on each of you in turn as if weighing a scale invisible to anyone else. She judged not posture or gear but whether you flinched at the aurora’s flicker, whether you shifted your stance when civilians muttered about outsiders, whether you asked questions that mattered or wasted her time with politics.</p>

<p>Helion Security behind her watched too closely, as if her approval was their cue to relax. It was an open secret that she was the spine of the unit. Without her, the line would sag into fear or cruelty. With her, they maintained a hard, brittle professionalism. The colony whispered about her: some called her a tyrant, others a shield. Children who played near the hazard lines imitated her barked orders. Miners painted her silhouette into mural margins, sometimes with a halo, sometimes with horns. In Haven, reputation was always painted twice.</p>

<p>Lira’s relationship with the factions was as precarious as the dome itself. Governor Orus Hestrel relied on her to keep Security presentable, though he clipped her reports before forwarding them to Helion’s Board. The Obsidian Accord trusted her competence but distrusted her loyalty; they preferred agents who bent optics into leverage, not officers who reported blunt truths. The Reclaimers tolerated her because she kept some of their people alive when numbers said they should have been dead. Even Zeratek, whose drones sometimes appeared on the wrong side of a barricade, respected her refusal to hide casualties. She was not beloved, but she was understood. In Haven, that was safer than love.</p>

<p>When the party stepped forward, her expression did not change, but her nod was the closest thing to welcome you would receive. “If you’re here to posture, turn back to the shuttle,” she said. “If you’re here to work, follow me. The Quarter won’t wait.”</p>

<div class="gm">
  <div class="gm-h">GM — Running Lira Veyne</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Demeanor:</b> Minimal words, maximum weight. She rewards clarity, despises wasted time.</li>
      <li><b>Trust:</b> PCs gain her respect by acting decisively, protecting civilians without being asked, or taking risks she recognizes as necessary. PCs lose her respect if they grandstand, stall, or prioritize optics.</li>
      <li><b>Factions:</b> Use her as a barometer. Accord = “Can you leverage her?” Reclaimers = “Does she keep us alive?” Helion = “Does she make us look stable?”</li>
      <li><b>Progression:</b> Patron if respected, rival if undercut, martyr if forced into impossible optics.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In this moment, as the aurora stitched itself into the dome like luminous thread, Captain Lira Veyne became the colony’s axis. Not because she was flawless, or beloved, or even victorious. But because without her, everything in Haven leaned toward collapse. She held the line not by shouting, but by standing still when everything else trembled. The party had not chosen her; the Accord had. But from here forward, the question would not be whether you followed her orders. It would be whether you could stand the weight of being measured and found either useful—or already breaking.</p>
  <h2 class="scene">Descent to the Quarter</h2>

<p>The elevator doors yawned open with a sigh of hydraulics older than most of the miners it carried. Inside, the cab was a grated cage that rattled like bones in a drum. Veyne gestured for you to step in, then followed last, posting herself by the controls. She pulled the lever with the casualness of someone who had done it a thousand times, and the floor lurched as gravity took over. The descent began with a shudder that traveled up your teeth.</p>

<p>Through slatted windows the colony revealed itself in slices. First came the mezzanine markets—stalls of synthetic fruit, bootleg stimulants, and salvaged drone parts arranged like talismans of survival. Faces turned upward at the sound of the elevator’s groan. Some faces were hopeful, others suspicious, and many bore the same etched weariness: the look of people who had survived so long they weren’t sure they wanted to keep paying the price. Children ran alongside the descending cab, laughing until the next flicker of the aurora made them stop and clutch each other’s hands.</p>

<p>The cab dropped further. You glimpsed a canteen where steam rolled against cracked glass. A man inside stirred a pot the size of a drum, his ladle carving lazy circles through a stew that looked more like boiled ration packs than food. A mural sprawled across the opposite wall: names painted in careful block letters. Thirty-two in all, each outlined in black. Space remained beneath them, blank rows awaiting additions. The elevator passed so close you could see where paint dripped, where some letters had been scrubbed clean and replaced with fresh names only weeks old.</p>

<p>Next came the infirmary. Queues stretched around pillars where hand-sanitizer dispensers blinked empty warnings. The smell of boiled antiseptic wafted through the vents and made eyes water. A nurse in a wrinkled coat glanced up as the cab passed, her expression unreadable. One patient in the line whispered, “Accord fixers,” and another muttered, “Helion’s dogs.” The words clung to the steel like oil—nothing clean here, nothing without residue.</p>

<p>At last the cab groaned to a halt on a platform sprayed with hazard-yellow lines. The doors clattered open. Here, the Quarter announced itself not with speeches but with the scrape of boots, the hiss of water lines, the coughs of tired lungs. The Quarter was Haven’s heart and its wound: where the colony’s laborers lived and worked, where production kept the dome breathing, where hope was rationed thinner than food.</p>

<p><b>Serin Vael</b> stood at a water manifold, sleeves rolled to the elbow. Her hands were steady but her voice was steel as she argued allocation with a technician who avoided her eyes. She was not dressed like a leader; she was dressed like everyone else, in coveralls patched at knees and elbows. What set her apart was not her clothing but the ledger she carried in her head: a mental accounting of who owed whom, who had earned trust, who had squandered it. She noticed you the instant the cab doors opened. Her gaze was sharp but not hostile. She took in your badges, your posture, and your silence—or lack of it.</p>

<p>Without waiting for formalities, she spoke. <em>“Row-C is running dry,”</em> she told Veyne. Then to you: <em>“And drones keep waking in tunnels they were never assigned to. Get my riggers home in one piece, and we’ll talk about trust.”</em></p>

<p>The crowd around the manifold stilled, listening not just to her words but to your reaction. Here, trust was a commodity traded more carefully than credits. Every blink, every hesitation, every half-smile weighed on scales you could not see. If you flinched, you were weakness. If you boasted, you were arrogance. If you listened and promised nothing, you might just be measured as worth the gamble.</p>

<div class="gm">
  <div class="gm-h">GM — Quarter Atmosphere</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Sensory detail:</b> Push the players with imagery—smell of ozone, rattle of pipes, coughing children. Make them feel <i>the Quarter is alive but sick</i>.</li>
      <li><b>Trust economy:</b> Serin is the Quarter’s conscience. PCs who promise rashly lose her favor. PCs who commit to tangible acts (carry water, fix a scanner, patch a sprain) gain her trust. Track <i>Quarter Morale</i> as +1/-1 depending on PC actions.</li>
      <li><b>Faction presence:</b> Reclaimers blend in with the crowd. Accord watchers linger on the edges. Helion Security stays close to Lira, not to protect her, but to watch the PCs.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A man with tired eyes pushed forward carrying a broken ration scanner. He held it out like an offering. “If you’re really here to help,” he said, “start with this. My kids can’t queue if the scanner reads them as frauds.” Behind him, a woman clutched a jug so heavy her knuckles whitened. She looked at you without speaking, but her gaze was louder than words. Around you, these silent requests multiplied until they became a chorus of small demands: a wrench turned, a pipe sealed, a bandage wrapped.</p>

<p>Veyne gave no orders. She watched, arms crossed, to see if you bent down to help or kept walking. Serin Vael’s lips pressed thin, recording your choice in her mental ledger. The Quarter did not ask for speeches. It asked for hands.</p>

<div class="gm">
  <div class="gm-h">GM — Quarter Skill Checks</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Carry water drums:</b> STR check, success = gratitude, failure = spilled ration water → Quarter Morale −1.</li>
      <li><b>Repair ration scanner:</b> INT check, success = families can eat, failure = sparks & burns → Accord Optics −1.</li>
      <li><b>Field-triage sprain:</b> WIS check, success = miner hobbles back to line, failure = pain worsens → Reclaimer Trust −1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">Each PC who chooses to stop and help can roll once. Reward +50 XP for selfless actions, regardless of outcome.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As the party moved deeper, the Quarter seemed to close around them. Narrow alleys funneled between stacked dormitories. Laundry lines drooped overhead, heavy with recycled water. Signs scrawled in chalk warned of ration cutbacks. The hum of the colony grew louder here—not just the drones, but the very bones of Haven: pipes clattering, pumps whining, circuits groaning like a tired animal. The Quarter lived, but every sound said it lived in pain.</p>

<p>When a child darted forward to touch one of you, her hand was clammy, her eyes wide. “Don’t let the singing come here,” she whispered, and then she was gone, pulled back into the crowd. No one acknowledged her words, but everyone seemed to hear them.</p>

<p>By the time you reached the tunnel entrance, Serin Vael’s presence lingered behind like a shadow. She had not promised you trust, but she had offered a ledger. In Haven, that was the closest thing to faith.</p>

  <h2 class="scene">The Tunnels</h2>
  <p>Conduits run like ribs. Condensation beads, swells, falls with a fat sound that makes even boots quieter. Someone has wired a charm of washers and colored fuse glass over a junction box so it will “sing right.” It hums a wrong note anyway.</p>
  <p>A drone lies on its side at the gallery mouth—a blossom-lens model out of <b>Zeratek’s</b> older catalogs. The casing is stamped, the serial scratched away with miner impatience. <b>Tannic “Rust” Varo</b>, forearms cross-hatched by work and time, checks resin charges with the patience of a man who has counted the dead before and means to keep the number small. <b>Meryn Ralos</b> from Helion Compliance holds a tablet like a shield and tries to make <i>help</i> sound like policy.</p>
  <div class="gm"><div class="gm-h">GM — NPC Reads</div><div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Rust:</b> plainspoken ally; +1 morale to any mixed crew he commands if the party backs his calls.</li>
      <li><b>Ralos:</b> opens records if protected; terrified of signing the wrong line; treats truth like glass.</li>
      <li><b>Veyne:</b> respects competence and speed; notes who takes the hard job without prompting.</li>
    </ul>
  </div></div>

  <h2 class="scene">Ambush in the Gallery</h2>
  <p>The tunnel opens into a jagged wound where vents should be tidy and braced. The air smells of resin and hot copper. At first you think the drones are wreckage—then the <b>blossom lenses</b> on two units twitch and center on motion. They lunge, then freeze—not like machines following a loop, but like animals listening for a count you can’t hear. Somewhere deep in the metal you feel a hum setting your jaw on edge.</p>

  <h3>Three Crises at Once</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>North shaft</b>: a misfired support buckled; a girder pins two miners; drones cut a neat, patient path toward a boot protruding under the beam.</li>
    <li><b>Main line</b>: workers with crate-lid shields hold, one push from rout.</li>
    <li><b>Maintenance alcove</b>: a child sits with knees hugged, listening to the hum. A drone noses an air grille like it can smell fear.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="gm"><div class="gm-h">GM — Combat Frame (AD&D 2e)</div><div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Scrap Drone (swarm)</b>: AC 7; HD 1d8; THAC0 20; DMG 1d6 cutter; MV 12; Morale 12 (check at first EMP/magnet pulse).</li>
      <li><b>Tactics</b>: +1 to hit if 3+ focus same target; prefer knees, tools, braces.</li>
      <li><b>Terrain</b>: catwalks; failing braces; resin smoke (save vs Poison each round in smoke or −1 to hit).</li>
      <li><b>Pacing</b>: Announce three fronts; give 30 seconds real time to pick a priority; run 3 sharp rounds before any reinforcement flips a lane.</li>
    </ul>
  </div></div>

  <h3>If they prioritize the North shaft</h3>
  <p>Rust wedges, grunts; you take the girder’s weight while cutters scream sparks off resin braces. Flesh-and-bone strength meets the industrial geometry of failure. One miner’s boot twitches; the other’s foot is too still.</p>
  <div class="gm"><div class="gm-h">Outcome</div><div class="gm-b">
    <p><b>Riggers’ Favor +1.</b> Line buckles (<i>Quarter Morale −1</i>) unless someone peels to shore it. If the line breaks: 1d4 civilians wounded; +1 <i>Accord Optics</i> if the party uses bodies, not speeches, to hold.</p>
  </div></div>

  <h3>If they prioritize the Main line</h3>
  <p>You plug the defense like a keystone. Shields rise on a single spoken count; the next push breaks on a wall that wasn’t there a heartbeat ago. Someone starts an old tunnel work song under their breath, and, weirdly, the washers on the charm keep time.</p>
  <div class="gm"><div class="gm-h">Outcome</div><div class="gm-b">
    <p>Order holds (no rout). <b>Accord Optics +1.</b> A pinned miner dies off-screen unless someone detached early (<i>Grief +1</i>). The child witnesses competence; mark <i>Row-C Owe</i> if someone notices him and says his name.</p>
  </div></div>

  <h3>If they prioritize the child</h3>
  <p>You reach the alcove as the cutter noses past the grille. The child doesn’t scream; he matches the hum like he’s trying to correct it. The first strike leaves a curl of plastic on the floor like a dead worm. The second strike is cleaner. He takes your hand and doesn’t let go. Behind you, people you didn’t choose to save do their best anyway.</p>
  <div class="gm"><div class="gm-h">Outcome</div><div class="gm-b">
    <p><b>Street Temperature +1.</b> Casualties rise elsewhere; <i>Quarter Morale −1</i> unless the party loops back fast. The child remembers who hummed the tune and will map it later in dots.</p>

    <p>Let smart positioning, tool use, and small heroics matter more than raw damage. Award XP for solutions that feel like <i>mining work</i>: bracing, rigging, jerry-rig EMPs, out-timing the hum.</p>
  </div></div>

  <h2 class="scene">Silence After</h2>
  <p>The last drone dies with a descending note that seems to shut the room. Everyone counts. Gratitude and anger arrive in equal measures, because both are honest. Rust squeezes a shoulder and leaves a clean glove print on grime. Ralos composes “intervention successful, losses incurred” and looks anywhere but at faces.</p>
  <p>Above, the aurora flickers—bright enough that for a second your mind supplies a wordless harmony it is sure it heard.</p>

  <div class="gm"><div class="gm-h">GM — Loot & Signals</div><div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Salvage:</b> abstract <i>0–100 cr</i> per drone or one <i>blossom lens</i> per 2–3 drones (stores 30s audio when magnetized).</li>

      <li><b>Clocks:</b> update <i>Quarter Morale</i>, <i>Street Temp</i>, <i>Accord Optics</i>, <i>Machine Wake</i> (start 0/6; +1 per uncanny electrical event).</li>
    </ul>
  </div></div>

  <h2 class="scene">Faces and Fallout</h2>
  <p><b>Rust</b> thanks you without letting you dodge consequences. “We live today because you chose. Next time, choose earlier or choose bigger.” He offers a tour of A-level rigs “when hands stop shaking.”</p>
  <p><b>Ralos</b> reframes the day into categories that look tidy from a boardroom. “If we call this a category-two variance and note that intervention reduced loss potential by… forty-two percent? Then procurement cannot claim negligence.” He blinks. “I can open records if someone—anyone—writes that opening them is necessary.”</p>
  <p>The rescued child watches the ceiling and counts lights under his breath. When one of you unconsciously hums the motif again, he stares at the ductwork like listening for a reply. He doesn’t take off the borrowed glove. He doesn’t let go of it, either.</p>

  <div class="gm"><div class="gm-h">GM — Allies & Leads</div><div class="gm-b">

      <li><b>Child</b>: later can match hummed notes to places; draws maps in dots; if protected, he’ll become a witness no one can discredit.</li>
