  <h2 class="scene">Arrival at the Spire</h2>

<p>The walk from the Quarter to Haven’s Spire was not long in distance, but every step measured the gulf between the colony’s halves. The air itself seemed to change—less grit, more perfume. Even the sound shifted: the rattle of pipes faded behind you, replaced by the muted hum of elevators polished until they gleamed like surgical steel. Lira Veyne strode ahead, a silent shadow, as if to remind you that your permission to climb was borrowed authority, not earned.</p>

<p>The Spire rose through the dome like a blade. Its mirrored skin caught the aurora’s glow, fracturing green-white light into shimmering rainbows that washed over Haven below. From the Quarter, those rainbows looked like beauty. Up close, they felt like surveillance. The glass did not reflect—it watched. Every mirrored panel seemed to ask whether you were worthy to stand in its presence.</p>

<p>Inside, the change was sharper still. Carpets muffled every footfall. Air scrubbers whispered a perfect monotone. Art from Bryndor and Kharsis lined the walls: abstract strokes and crystal sculptures, carefully curated to suggest cultural unity without risking anything as dangerous as specificity. Overhead, a mural of Solus Tarsis, the system’s star, blazed in golden paint, its rays reaching every corner of the atrium. It was less a celebration than a warning: the star gave life, and it could burn you away just as easily.</p>

<p>At the stair’s base stood <b>Governor Orus Hestrel</b>. His suit was pressed to the point of hostility, his smile measured in degrees. Subtle drones hovered in orbit, recording every angle. He radiated warmth with the precision of a manufactured hearth. “Welcome to Haven’s Spire,” he began, voice pitched perfectly to reach both you and the cameras. “The Quarter may look to you as saviors. Here, you will be judged as stabilizers. I trust you know the difference.”</p>

<p>To his right lingered <b>Kaelen Drix</b>, Zeratek’s liaison. His cufflinks gleamed, his smirk practiced. Every gesture seemed rehearsed to strike a balance between affable and calculating. He eyed the drone wreckage you carried—or the scratches on your armor—and smiled faintly, as if already calculating the cost of your survival in corporate ledgers. To his left, <b>Director Sael</b> of Compliance Medicine wore pale robes that made him look less like an administrator and more like an officiant at a funeral. He held a clipboard, and his eyes moved across you like a physician diagnosing a terminal condition.</p>

<p>For a moment, silence fell. Then the aurora flickered through the Spire’s high glass roof. Green-white threads pulsed three times, then fell silent. The same motif you had heard in the tunnels, the same cadence the child had hummed. None of the three flinched. Perhaps they had trained themselves not to hear. Or perhaps they had heard it too often to care.</p>

<blockquote>“Stability is a fragile currency,” Hestrel continued, voice sharpened to a knife’s edge. “I will not see Haven bankrupted by panic. Tell me, Accord agents—what have you brought me?”</blockquote>

<p>Your answer mattered less than how you framed it. Hestrel wanted proof you could be spun into optics. Drix wanted leverage to twist against competitors. Sael wanted compliance, preferably volunteered. Every word would ripple outward, recorded, dissected, and replayed until the Spire could decide whether you were assets—or liabilities.</p>

  <div class="gm-h">GM — Running the Spire Opener</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Governor Hestrel:</b> Treat him as optics incarnate. He never asks for truth, only narratives. PCs who challenge him risk Accord Optics −1; PCs who match his spin gain +1 Accord Optics.</li>
      <li><b>Kaelen Drix:</b> Smiles constantly. Always asks about salvage. If PCs admit to carrying drone parts, he demands return “for safety review.” PCs who resist gain Reclaimer Trust +1 but provoke Zeratek hostility.</li>
      <li><b>Director Sael:</b> Soft voice, sharp control. He offers screenings for “stress.” Any PC who accepts will be marked for later compliance experiments. PCs who refuse publicly risk optics but gain quiet Reclaimer respect.</li>
      <li><b>Optics:</b> The entire encounter is recorded. Have NPCs repeat PC words back with twists. Make them feel scrutinized at every turn.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<p>The chamber seemed to tighten around you as each faction leaned forward with their unspoken demands. Hestrel’s smile waited for a speech he could edit into victory. Drix’s smirk promised paperwork and price tags. Sael’s stillness was almost worse than words. And above, the aurora flickered again, a reminder that the Spire’s walls did not shield you from Haven’s deeper song.</p>

<p>Veyne broke the silence. “They bought us time,” she said flatly. “In the Quarter. You want to know if they’re stabilizers? Ask the people still breathing.” Her words cut through the theatrics like a blade. But Hestrel only smiled wider, because even defiance could be spun into narrative.</p>

<p>For the first time since entering the Spire, the question hung heavy in the air: would you play their game—or break it?</p>
