        <ul>
          <li><b>Arrival:</b> PCs entered Haven under Accord mandate amid outages and factional tension.</li>
          <li><b>Helion:</b> Governor Hestrel pressed calm for the Board; Veyne tested the Accord’s deniable assets.</li>
          <li><b>Reclaimers:</b> Serin Vael and Rust Varo pressed dignity, risking everything to trust outsiders.</li>
          <li><b>Zeratek:</b> Kaelen Drix angled to bury emitter faults, trading fixes with blackmail clauses.</li>
          <li><b>Compliance:</b> Director Sael offered sedation in exchange for quiet. “Screenings” as stability.</li>
          <li><b>Accord:</b> Saint demanded receipts only truth could carry, refusing optics or spin.</li>
          <li><b>The Choir:</b> Variances hummed, wires sang. Miners whispered <i>the Choir</i> and would not repeat it.</li>
          <li><b>Silent Guide:</b> Ren led PCs with burned modules and variance logs, throat ruined but message intact.</li>
          <li><b>The Crawl:</b> Dampeners spent, sparks endured, proof carried through veins of Haven’s Factory.</li>

        </ul>
      </div>

    <p class="meta">Mandate: leave the Factory with proof intact, decide who receives it first, and survive the spin war. Timers: <b>Audit Window</b>, <b>Helion Response</b>, <b>Compliance Sweep</b>.</p>

    <!-- SCENE 1 -->
    <h2 class="scene" id="a10-s1">Scene 1 — The Stair That Chooses You</h2>
    <blockquote><i>“Truth arrives late to meetings but ruins the agenda.”</i> — Saint</blockquote>

    <p>
      The Factory groaned as you left its underbelly. Stairs, ramps, and lifts shifted, rearranging themselves like bureaucrats drafting a budget: patient, deliberate, cruel. What should have been a straightforward exfiltration became a ritual of choices, each stairwell painted with allegiance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>north stair</b> gleamed in municipal gray, the paint almost honest. The <b>east lift</b whispered lullabies through its hum, “wellness” threaded into its current. The <b>south ramp</b carried the smell of oil and sweat, a road of workers and smudged walls.
    </p>

    <div class="gm collapsible">
      <div class="gm-h">GM — Exit Fork</div>
      <div class="gm-b">
        <ul>
          <li><b>North Stair (Helion Optics):</b> Clean optics, harder testimony. +1 Helion Stability.</li>
          <li><b>East Lift (Compliance):</b> Fast but flagged. Save vs. Spells or −2 to first reaction roll. +1 Compliance Control.</li>
          <li><b>South Ramp (Accord Streets):</b> Gritty, riskier now, stronger later. +1 Reclaimer Trust, +2 if Ren visible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small"><b>Note:</b> If Audit Window ≤ 1h, trigger <i>Internal Sweep</i> (2 drones + 1 Compliance team).</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SCENE 2 -->
    <h2 class="scene" id="a10-s2">Scene 2 — Who Gets the Truth</h2>
    <blockquote><i>“Testimony is a weapon that breaks in the hand that lies.”</i> — Reclaimer proverb</blockquote>

    <p>
      The proof weighed more than its fragments. Burned modules, variance logs, and the Icon of Compliance—any one could topple careers or spark riots. All together, they promised a story Haven would not survive unscarred. But first, someone must own that story.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Helion’s lobby</b> awaited in sterile light, screens ready to broadcast calm. <b>The Accord</b> waited in a quiet room, Saint ready with ink instead of cameras. <b>The Reclaimers</b> gathered in Graywater, the street murmuring for justice.
    </p>

      <div class="gm-b">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Helion:</b> Gain Stability; lose Accord Optics. PCs framed as calm escorts. Helion holds narrative.</li>

    <!-- SCENE 3 -->
    <h2 class="scene" id="a10-s3">Scene 3 — The Choir’s Invitation</h2>
    <blockquote><i>“When a machine sings without power, ask not what debt was paid.”</i> — Accord field notes</blockquote>

    <p>
      The evidence handed off, the Choir did not retreat. Lights bent, wires whispered, aurora stitched across the dome’s skin. The city itself began to sing—a hymn or a warning. Every choice echoed, not in optics, but in resonance.
    </p>

    <p>
      One by one, familiar figures turned their faces upward: Veyne at the Spire steps, Saint beneath dim lamps, Serin in Graywater. All heard the same note. Haven itself was being tuned.

          <li><b>Save vs. Spells:</b> Fail = temporary surrender, +1 Choir Influence. Success = resist the voice.</li>
          <li><b>Lira Veyne:</b> If PCs resist, she offers to hunt Choir roots. If they join, she marks them as lost.</li>
          <li><b>Saint:</b> Demands Accord doctrine be read against the song. PCs may anchor or fracture his faith.</li>
          <li><b>Serin/Rust:</b> If PCs join, they witness betrayal; if PCs resist, they become bulwarks for Graywater.</li>
