  <h1 class="scene">Arc 3 — Echoes in the Dark</h1>
  <p class="meta">The Quarter’s tunnels breathe like a sleeping beast. The Choir’s motif—three rising, one falling—answers to no human chain of command. The Accord’s mandate narrows: follow the signal, prove intent, survive the dark.</p>

  <!-- ===================== Scene 1 ===================== -->
  <h2 class="scene">Scene 1 — Descent to Row-C</h2>
<p>The lift rattled past paint that had learned to peel in straight lines. Lights stuttered in a rhythm that matched no grid you’d seen, but your bones recognized it anyway. The Quarter opened like a throat—steam, noise, the hot breath of machines working past their promises.</p>
<p>Rust Varo met you at the mouth of the tunnel, palms scarred, voice even. “You brought helmets. Good. Down there, the air forgets it’s for people.” Serin Vael’s mark chalked the doorway: a slanted V, the angle of a pick held correctly. The tunnel swallowed the mark after the first corner.</p>
<p>The hum began as a rumor of sound, felt first in teeth and wrists. Three pulses rose, one fell, the pattern of a heartbeat someone had taught to count different. Pipes sweated. Old Zeratek conduit, left from the first build, wore a skin of condensation like it wanted to be touched and didn’t. Toll, the junior engineer, stayed close to your shadow and called out junctions by the name the ducts had told him. “Warm idle… cool awake… don’t run when it goes quiet.”</p>
<p>Rust tapped gauges that had been dead long enough to gather superstition. A needle twitched against zero, then lay down again. “See? It listens. Doesn’t mean it hears us.” The floor pitch changed—a subtle decline—and your breath fogged less, as if the tunnel remembered summer. Far away, metal rang once, like a dropped wrench deciding not to be found.</p>
<p>Chalk marks—white, then charcoal, then fingernail—made a breadcrumb trail along the wall. Some had been scrubbed away with a gloved palm. Others were fresh enough to powder your sleeve when you brushed past. The last mark before the first ladder was a single dot. Toll wouldn’t look at it. “Kid made those,” he said to the floor. “Kept time with the lights.”</p>
<p>At the ladder the motif thickened. Your hands tingled around the rungs as if you’d gripped a story told too many times. Down three flights the air took on the penny taste of wet copper. A draft moved against you from deeper in, not strong, but steady—the sort of breath a sleeping thing takes when it is dreaming of work.</p>

<div class="gm collapsible open">
  <div class="gm-h">GM — Running the Descent</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Navigation:</b> WIS check vs. 12 to keep bearings. Failure: lose 1 turn; the motif momentarily stops (unease), then resumes louder.</li>
      <li><b>Hazards:</b> Slick ladder (DEX check to avoid slip; failure = 1d3 subdual), stale pocket (save vs. Breath Weapon; failure = −1 to attacks for 1 turn).</li>
      <li><b>Motif Stress:</b> Each full turn in “hot zones” → roll 2d6; on 3 or less, a PC gains trembling hands (−1 missile attacks) until rest.</li>
      <li><b>Guides:</b> With Rust/Toll: +2 to Navigation. If alone: DC +2 and add a false-echo fork (wastes 1d6×10 minutes).</li>
      <li><b>Clue Cache:</b> INT vs. 12 to reconstruct the scrubbed chalk (“dot language”); success grants +2 on a later pursuit/escape.</li>
      <li><b>Quiet Test (optional):</b> If the group chooses to move silently, roll Move Silently (or DEX vs. 12). Success grants surprise against first hazard (Scene 3); failure creates a falling-tool noise that alerts one construct.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

  <!-- ===================== Scene 2 ===================== -->
  <h2 class="scene">Scene 2 — Echo Mapping</h2>
<p>At the junction belly named <i>cool awake</i>, the air stiffened. Your lamps looked smaller here. The walls sweated cleanly, beads marching downhill in drill-sergeant lines toward the sump. Someone had wedged a Zeratek diagnostic wand into a crack and taped its speaker shut. Even gagged, it vibrated with the motif like a throat trying not to sing.</p>
<p>You planted the Accord wafer Lira gave you; the triangulation readout was ugly but honest. Three spikes walked across the display like footfalls—rise, rise, rise, fall—each lag a crude compass, each pitch a guess at depth. When the aurora above the dome pulsed, the spikes flinched in sympathy and settled closer together, like they wanted to agree on a destination.</p>
<p>Rust knelt and pressed his palm flat to the floor. “Weight’s wrong,” he said. “Like the ground’s expecting something heavy and being polite about it.” Toll worried a strip of tape off the gagged wand and let one note escape. It trembled through the floor and came back as two, then three, then the fourth dropping out like a tooth pulled clean.</p>
<p>The child’s dot-map matched the spikes if you turned it ninety degrees and trusted a dead kid’s rhythm. Lines began to mean distance; dots meant places the hum preferred. Together they drew a curve that didn’t follow tunnels so much as intent, bending toward a maintenance door half drowned in silt. The stencil had been eaten down to bones of letters: <i>F—13 S—MP</i>. Someone had cleaned the handle recently. The metal shone with the small, guilty pride of a job done at the wrong time.</p>

<div class="gm collapsible open">
  <div class="gm-h">GM — The Mapping Minigame</div>
  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Triangulate:</b> 3 rounds: choose <i>INT</i> (logic) or <i>WIS</i> (intuition). Success on 2+ rounds = pinned vector (PCs gain +1 init in Scene 3). Failure on 2+ = −1 to surprise checks.</li>
      <li><b>Data Merge:</b> Using <i>Child’s Dot-Map</i> + <i>Accord Wafer</i> = +2 on one round of choice.</li>
      <li><b>Risk Option:</b> Un-gag wand for +2 that round; each time, save vs. Spells or gain “vertigo echo” (−2 to next roll).</li>
      <li><b>Pulse Window (reward):</b> On overall success, bank one party-wide +2 on a single later group check (positioning or retreat).</li>
      <li><b>Side Discovery (new):</b> Careful search (turn spent; INT vs. 10) finds a <i>maintenance bypass latch</i> near the sump door—gives advantage on forcing it quietly in Scene 3.</li>
      <li><b>False Harmony (new risk):</b> If anyone hums along to “hear it better,” roll save vs. Spells. Failure: they unconsciously drift toward the door, triggering the ambush unless restrained.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

  <!-- ===================== Scene 3 ===================== -->
  <h2 class="scene">Scene 3 — The Sump at F-13</h2>
<p>The maintenance door opened like a jaw pushed past rigor. The sump beyond sloped into a black pool where Haven’s waste water learned patience. Your beams found the curve of a submerged pipe, the ribs of a conduit, and the spine of something that used to be a drone. Thin filaments hung from the ceiling, quivering to a rhythm the ear pretended not to hear.</p>
<p>It rose from the water in jointed silence, not a droplet falling from its skin. The Blossom lens sat where an eye might be, its iris a shield of hexagonal glass. Three lights pulsed under it; the fourth stuttered and fell, and your stomach answered like it had been tutored. Along the rim, two shapes unfolded from scrap—striders built from plates, cable, and stubbornness.</p>
<p>The room hummed at a frequency that found the small bones of the ear and set them whispering treason to your balance. The catwalk’s rail buzzed like a tuning fork. In the pool, oily crescents of rainbow skated away from your lamp and regrouped with intent. Somewhere behind the drone’s eye a relay clicked in fours, and the water’s surface dimpled as if it, too, had learned to breathe.</p>

      <li><b>Stunts:</b> <i>Kick the rail</i> (STR vs. 12) for vibrating grit (targets below save vs. Breath or −2 next attack). <i>Ignite filaments</i> (oil/torch) → 10’ smoky line (concealment; striders take 1d3 crossing).</li>

      <li><b>Loot/Clues:</b> <i>Blossom Lens (cracked)</i>, <i>Firmware Shard</i> tagged <i>CHOIR_SAFE</i>, 2× <i>Pulse Dampeners</i>. Formal hand-in: 300 cr (1–2 legal sidearms). Keeping them: +Reclaimer Trust.</li>

    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The drone’s last light flickered a stubborn, failing rhythm. When it died, the room forgot its song. Silence rushed in like water into air—heavy, immediate, judgmental. In the sludge near the conduit you found the shard: hardened memory with a fresh label that lied cheerfully. <i>CHOIR_SAFE</i>. Someone had named the danger “safety” and taught it to sing.</p>

  <!-- ===================== Bridge ===================== -->
  <h2 class="scene">Bridge to Arc 4 — The Mouths of Power</h2>
  <p>By the time you climbed back to the Quarter, Haven had grown new arguments. Reclaimer stewards wanted the dampeners for the tunnels. Helion wanted the shard for optics. Zeratek wanted everything in a sealed case with your signatures drying on top. The aurora pulsed once, twice, three times. Somewhere, a broadcast rehearsed its smile.</p>
