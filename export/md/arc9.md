<div class="gm-h">

GM — Phase I Recap (10 Bullets)

</div>

<div class="gm-b">

- **Arrival:** PCs entered Haven under Obsidian Accord mandate, walking
  into factional tension and unexplained outages.
- **Helion’s Optics:** Governor Orus Hestrel wanted calm for the Board,
  while Captain Lira Veyne tested the party’s resolve under fire.
- **Quarter Unrest:** The Reclaimers pressed for safety and dignity;
  Serin Vael and Rust Varo offered fragile trust.
- **Zeratek’s Shadow:** Kaelen Drix angled to hide faulty emitters while
  selling diagnostics with strings attached.
- **Compliance Medicine:** Director Sael extended “screenings” and
  sedation euphemized as stability, offering calm with costs.
- **Accord’s Watcher:** Saint demanded proof unspinnable by optics;
  Accord trust grows only through receipts, not promises.
- **The Choir Emerges:** Electrical variances whispered rhythms in ducts
  and wires; miners called it *the Choir* but would not repeat it.
- **Silent Evidence:** Ren, a worker silenced at the throat, led PCs to
  proof—burned modules, variance logs, and the Icon of Compliance.
- **The Conduit Crawl:** PCs survived three surges, spent dampener
  charges, and carried proof out through crawling steel veins.
- **Final Stakes:** With evidence in hand, factions circling, and the
  Choir offering invitation, PCs must decide who gets the truth first.

Mandate: leave the Factory with proof intact, decide who gets it first,
and survive the spin war. The Choir won’t chase; it will **invite**.
Timers: **Audit Window** (if any remains), **Helion Response**,
**Compliance Sweep**.

The overlook held a thin wind that couldn’t be from outside, yet tasted
of night. Below, the Factory’s lines ran in obedient geometry, light
pulsing like a measured breath. Behind you, the crawlspace hatch clicked
as if counting—one, two, three—waiting for you to become another rhythm.
You carried proof that could end jobs, or save lives, or both, depending
on the room in which it was read aloud.

## Scene 1 — The Stair That Chooses You

> *“Truth arrives late to meetings but ruins the agenda.”* — Saint

Exfiltration should have been simple: retrace the crawl, duck through
service doors, climb the same stairs down which the Factory had
swallowed you. Instead, the building rearranged itself with the patient
cruelty of bureaucracy. When you reached the first junction, three new
exits stood waiting, none of them where they had been, each one lit in a
different register of kindness.

The **north stair** carried the honest gray of municipal paint, the kind
used on walls of hospitals and civic centers. The smell rising from it
was faintly of old coffee and wax, like morning meetings no one wanted
to attend. Fluorescent lights buzzed without flicker, but the hum
beneath them was not electrical—it was rhythmic, almost like a heartbeat
pacing your steps in advance. Somewhere far above, you could swear you
heard the shuffle of shoes, as if an audience waited already.

The **east lift** was a mouth of brushed steel, wide doors lit by a
wellness-blue strip. A pleasant chime sounded as you drew close, melodic
and almost reassuring. Its screen scrolled slogans in corporate font:
*Wellness is Productivity. Your Safety is Our Outcome.* The letters
lingered too long, as though aware they were lying. The air smelled
faintly of antiseptic and lavender, a staged comfort that made the hairs
on your arms lift. The lift whispered speed, but also surveillance.

The **service ramp south** bore yellow hazard chevrons faded by years of
traffic. It sloped into shadow, grease streaking the walls, the smell of
coolant and fried circuitry drifting upward. The silence there was not
absence, but secrecy: the kind of quiet where people whispered names of
the dead and believed the walls kept confidence. On the edge of hearing,
you caught a faint, childish *ta-ta-ta*, like a game being played in
ducts too small for adults. Ren froze when he heard it. He pressed
fingers to his throat and looked at you, eyes wet and furious, as if
daring you to pretend you hadn’t noticed.

Tala shifted her lamp beam between the three choices, her face hard with
calculation. “The Factory isn’t showing exits,” she muttered. “It’s
showing *judgments*.” She clicked the lamp off for a second. In the
dark, the hums and scents grew louder, clearer, as if competing for your
consent. When she clicked it back on, she added, “Whatever you choose,
it’ll write itself in the record. Someone’s keeping the minutes.”

Each step of choice felt heavier than the last. Even breathing seemed to
set off echoes: when you inhaled, the lights of the north stair flared.
When you exhaled, the lift’s chime ticked softly, as if congratulating
you. The ramp whispered nothing, and its silence was more demanding than
the other two’s invitations.

<div class="gm-h">

GM — Exit Fork

</div>

<div class="gm-b">

- **North Stair (Helion Optics):** Clean route through monitored areas.
  Easy Stealth now, harder spin later. Helion Stability +1 if used (they
  “escorted” you out on camera). Gain access to Spire lobby without
  alarms.
- **East Lift (Compliance Shadow):** Fast but flagged. Save vs. Spells
  to resist lull from “wellness” chime; failure = −2 to first reaction
  roll in Scene 2. Compliance Control +1 on use.
- **South Ramp (Accord Street):** Dirtier route through service bays and
  Graywater alleys. More checks now; better optics for Accord if you
  emerge with workers. Reclaimer Trust +1 on success, +2 if Ren
  accompanies.

**Note:** If Audit Window ≤ 1h, trigger a roving *Internal Sweep* (2
drones + 1 Compliance pair) on the first failed Move Silently/Hiding
roll regardless of route.

</div>

</div>

Ren tugged at your sleeve. He pointed first toward the stair, then
toward his chest, shaking his head—he would not survive more optics. He
pointed at the lift, then made a sign of sleep, his jaw tight with
warning. Finally he pointed at the ramp, then at the ground, fingers
splaying wide to mean *roots*, *home*. His silence spoke louder than the
three exits combined.

Tala met your eyes. “We can’t stand here long. The building counts us
every breath. Sooner or later it’ll notice the math doesn’t add up. And
then it’ll adjust.” The lamp flickered once as if to prove her point.

Whichever choice you made, the Factory rearranged itself to accept it.
The stair hummed louder, the lift’s chime sharpened, the ramp exhaled
heat like a furnace’s sigh. Even before your foot touched the first
step, you knew the path wasn’t an exit at all—it was testimony, recorded
by walls that had learned to sing.

## Scene 2 — Who Gets the Truth

> “Testimony is a weapon that breaks in the hand that lies.” — Reclaimer
> proverb

Haven’s corridors remembered you faster on the way out. Doors pre-opened
by a quarter, cameras panned politely away, and the floor stopped
whispering safety reminders. It was as if the Factory itself had decided
you were finished and now the city would decide what to make of you.
Outside the last threshold, night pressed against the dome, aurora
stitching the sky in restless green-white threads. Sirens tested their
voices and quit, unwilling to speak before you did.

Three destinations waited, none of them secret. Each was a mouth that
wanted to swallow the proof you carried, chew it into a shape the public
could digest, and spit the rest into silence. Each was also a wager
about who would own tomorrow’s story.

**The Spire’s lobby** was lit like a cathedral of glass and optics.
Governor Orus Hestrel had arranged the angles, knowing which corners
flattered and which lights erased shadows. Potted trees disguised
tripods; cameras nested discreetly in the leaves, the way birds trust a
place not to shake. Hestrel stood at the top of the steps, suit the
color of outcomes, tie the color of patience. He raised his chin at you
as if framing you for an invisible audience. Lira Veyne flanked him,
helmet under her arm, braid coiled tight. Her eyes met yours with an
unspoken message: *don’t let him spin you into silence*. When your pack
shifted, both of them noticed, and the cameras leaned closer like
predators that smelled blood.

**The Accord office** lay two tiers below, an anonymous cube with
unmarked walls. Inside, Saint had stripped the place bare of comforts.
No chairs, no desk, no window—only the gravity of her presence. She did
not sit; she let the room remain unbalanced so every word would wobble
before finding purchase. “What did they make you sing?” she asked,
softly, like a doctor who knew the answer but needed to hear you bleed
it out. When you laid down your proof, she arranged it without touching,
headlines taking shape in the empty air. Her face was calm, but her eyes
were storm maps, tracking where the surge would land. Accord couriers
waited in shadow, pens already inked.

**Graywater’s Market Quarter** burned with lamps strung low, oil and
cheap neon reflecting off puddles that never dried. The air smelled of
fast-fried meat, solder smoke, and promises bought in handfuls. Serin
Vael stood on a pallet, voice sharp enough to cut the night. Rust Varo
flanked her, his presence promising that whatever happened here, no
worker would face it alone. When you raised the film, the crowd hushed,
the way mobs do when they decide history is watching. Children clambered
onto crates for a better look. Miners pressed their hands together as if
in prayer. “Say it,” Serin urged. “Say it where they can’t claim you
whispered.” Her eyes burned at you like a forge, and when you placed the
proof in her hands, it weighed the entire square.

GM — Delivery Fork & Consequences

</div>

<div class="gm-b">

- **Deliver to Helion (Spire lobby):** Hestrel receives proof with
  cameras rolling. If sanitized (no Choir language) → Helion Stability
  +2, Accord Optics −1. If “your mouths are ours” included → Compliance
  Control +1, leverage banked for later. Lira’s loyalty may fracture:
  protect PCs if they’re spun, or pull back if sidelined.
- **Deliver to the Accord (Saint):** +2 Accord Optics (+3 if Ren
  present). Helion Stability −1. Saint demands immediate publishing. PCs
  can delay by spending CHA/INT checks, earning a Favor token instead.
- **Deliver to the Street (Reclaimers/Graywater):** Reclaimer Trust +2;
  Accord Optics +1; Helion Stability −2 if phrase “your mouths are ours”
  chanted by crowd. CHA check required to keep rally controlled; failure
  → trigger Orderly Dispersal attempt (nonlethal sweep, risk
  escalation).

<!-- -->

- **Ren’s Fate:** To Spire → sidelined by “care protocols” (Compliance
  Control +1). To Accord → becomes living testimony (+1 Accord Optics).
  To Street → protected, but hunted in Phase II (hook).

</div>

</div>

The decision was not about safety—it was about *who owned the silence
you were about to break*. In the Spire, Hestrel smiled the way men smile
when they believe the outcome is already theirs. Lira’s jaw tightened,
her eyes telling you she would rather die than see your words clipped.
In the Accord office, Saint’s lips hardly moved, but you felt the weight
of her ledger, already measuring lives in columns. In Graywater, Serin’s
fire met the aurora overhead, and for a heartbeat it was hard to tell
which burned brighter.

Whatever choice you made, the night reshaped itself to record it.
Cameras blinked red; crowds leaned forward; couriers unfurled parchment
like scripture. The aurora’s rhythm pressed closer to the dome, as if
even the sky was waiting to see who you trusted first.

## Scene 3 — The Choir’s Invitation

> “When a machine sings without power, ask not where the current came
> from but what debt was paid.” — Accord field notes

The choice of where to place the truth was yours, but Haven did not wait
for outcomes. The aurora pulsed harder, green-white bands widening
across the dome as if the sky had been wound too tight and now sought
release. Power grids hiccuped; screens blinked; elevators halted
mid-tier with passengers locked inside. The city’s breath staggered.
Somewhere below, the pipes carried a sound not waterborne—a tone,
layered and patient, threading through steel. A voice without a body,
humming through the bones of the dome.

Ren clutched your sleeve (if alive), whispering what witnesses feared to
say: “That’s the Choir. That’s the sound we aren’t supposed to hear
twice.” Their eyes were too wide, reflecting aurora that no human iris
should hold. Even if Ren was gone, the words surfaced in memory—his
final warning carried on the static itself.

Crowds shifted uneasily whether you stood in the Spire, the Accord cube,
or Graywater’s square. No one taught them the tune, but already miners
mouthed along to the rhythm. Some clutched their throats as if chords
were not notes but *openings*. Children tilted their heads, smiling at
nothing. The aurora’s shimmer began to sync with the lights of Haven’s
tower, and in the brief second between pulses, silence pressed so
completely that hearts sounded like engines in the ribs.

Saint’s voice, if near, cut thin as wire: “Do you hear who’s writing the
next headline?” Hestrel’s lips moved soundlessly, the Governor staging
words no microphone caught. Serin Vael spat into the dust, muttering
that the city itself had picked sides. Lira Veyne’s hand hovered over
her sidearm—not at you, not at the crowd, but at the ceiling as if she
could shoot the sky into silence. And all of them, for one unguarded
moment, looked smaller than you expected leaders could be.

The Choir’s presence was not loud. It was *intimate*. A whisper inside
ducts, behind eyelids, under the pressure of blood in the ear. The kind
of sound that does not enter by hearing but by remembering. You realized
with creeping certainty that some part of you had always known this
song—it had waited for recognition like a name too long unspoken.

Then the dome itself cracked light: a seam opening above Haven’s core
tower. Not broken, but *parted*, as if a hand had drawn curtains back to
let something peer through. The aurora pooled downward, forming a funnel
of color that brushed rooftops and froze drones mid-patrol. In its
current, faces blinked in and out—worker, soldier, child—each mouth
moving with words no one could quite parse. Some faces belonged to the
living; others were already names carved into memorial walls.

GM — The Choir’s Contact

</div>

<div class="gm-b">

- **Effect:** All PCs must make a *Save vs. Spells* (AD&D 2e). Failure →
  character hums involuntarily for 1d4 rounds, unable to act except to
  move toward the light. Success → hold ground, gain fragmentary vision
  (“Veyra is not alone”).
- **Lira Veyne:** Auto-saves first round, then begins humming unless PCs
  intervene. Her survival here shifts Phase II alliances.
- **Saint:** Uses the moment to record. Accord Optics +1 if she
  survives. PCs who protect her couriers gain Accord Favor.
- **Serin Vael/Rust:** If present, attempt to rally crowd. CHA checks DC
  15; success → +1 Reclaimer Trust; fail → panic causes casualties (−1
  Stability).

<!-- -->

- **Combat Trigger:** Zeratek drones reboot with new firmware, hostile
  to *all*. AC 4, THAC0 17, 10 HP. Swarm until PCs disengage or disrupt
  the aurora funnel.

</div>

</div>

The song was no longer ambient—it chose you. Your proof, whichever hands
held it, vibrated with resonance as if the Choir itself reached through
the data to claim authorship. Text scrolled across screens though no
terminal was powered: *your mouths are ours*. The phrase repeated in
cascading fonts, sizes, languages—until even ancient dialects of the
Belt scrawled across walls. Somewhere in the tunnels, alarms failed
because they too were trying to *sing*.

The air tasted metallic, like copper wires stripped with teeth. Cold
sweat broke out across crowds. Some miners began tearing at their
clothes as though to shed flesh too heavy for the rhythm. Accord
couriers fainted. Helion guards fired warning shots, and the bullets
themselves left contrails of light that bent toward the aurora’s funnel.
Even silence became theater here; even breath carried the weight of
testimony.

At the crescendo, the aurora’s funnel touched the plaza. Where it kissed
the ground, concrete glowed and *shifted*, as though the city was
learning to breathe through stone. A voice—many voices braided—spoke
inside every skull at once: *“Mouths. Sing. Choir.”* The words were not
a command but an invitation, a door without hinges. Step through, and
you risked never returning the same.

<div class="gm collapsible open">

<div class="gm-h">

GM — Player Options at the Invitation

</div>

<div class="gm-b">

- **Join the Choir:** PCs who step willingly into the aurora funnel gain
  visions (GM improvises Phase II foreshadowing). Mechanical effect:
  temporary +2 WIS, −2 STR, and a permanent “Choir Mark” that other
  factions can detect.
- **Resist Together:** Group CHA/INT checks. Success → PCs ground each
  other, aurora retreats one tier. Failure → funnel deepens; 1d6 drones
  spawn and one faction leader is captured (GM choice).
- **Divert/Redirect:** Magic or tech use allowed to bend aurora into
  machinery. Success (INT + WIS checks, DC 16) → PCs seize momentary
  leverage: Phase II starts with a Favor Token from any faction. Failure
  → feedback burns PCs for 1d6 damage each.

No “safe” option exists. Whatever the party chooses, the aurora marks
Haven forever. Phase II begins under the shadow of the Choir’s
awakening.

</div>

</div>

When the funnel finally withdrew, retreating into the sky like a tide
pulling back from black sand, Haven exhaled a sound like a thousand
shutters closing. Lights flickered, hearts steadied, and for a breath
the world seemed ordinary again. But the silence that followed was not
*absence*—it was *ownership*. The Choir had written itself into the
city’s ledger, and everyone alive would remember their invitation.

Saint folded her recorder, lips a grim line. Hestrel adjusted his tie
twice in silence. Serin wiped her palms on her trousers, leaving streaks
like oil. Lira stared at the sky, whispering that Haven had just lost
command of its own voice. Whether you had resisted or joined, saved or
surrendered, the verdict was already entered: Phase I of your mission
was over. The city was no longer yours alone. The Choir was awake, and
it would not sleep again.

## Phase II Bridge — After the First Song

Phase I concludes when proof is lodged and the invitation is resolved.
