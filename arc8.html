  <h2 class="scene" id="a8-s1">Scene 1 — Quiet Floors, Watching Walls</h2>
<blockquote>“Factories don’t make products. They make obedience.” — Saint</blockquote>

<p>
The door unclenched and you stepped into a silence that wasn’t absence, but design. The Factory’s floors gleamed with a polish that no worker had applied in years, their shine produced by drones that preferred reflection to dust. Overhead, rows of lights burned steady white, too steady—never flickering, never dimming. The kind of light that forgets you’re a person and assumes you’re a part number.
</p>

<p>
Your boots met surface with a soft report, and that sound was eaten by the walls. Each corridor was paneled in acoustic baffles that made footsteps seem ashamed of themselves. Even whispers bent short, returning to the ear smaller than when they left. It was a building built to hear, not to speak.
</p>

<p>
The dampener’s hush clung like a cloak, but you could feel the resistance. The walls pulsed faintly when you moved, as though some current was running not just through conduits but through stone, wire, and air itself. The smell here was a mixture of solder and disinfectant, like someone had tried to sterilize a circuit board and failed.
</p>

<p>
Tala signed with her hand: <i>eyes everywhere</i>. She was right. Along the ceilings, pan-tilt units with dull lenses swiveled in programmed arcs. Their hums harmonized with the child’s rhythm, matching beats every third pass. When the dampener surged, the rhythm fell out of time for a moment—long enough to make sweat bead before it realigned itself.
</p>

<p>
The corridor opened into a floor bay: rows of conveyor lines still, but not abandoned. Each belt bore crates, all stenciled with codes, none with destinations. The labels were nonsensical—strings of digits punctuated by fragments of words. <i>…variance…consent…deficit…</i> The words changed if you looked twice, letters rearranging like they had places to be.
</p>

<p>
On the far wall, a projection flickered to life unbidden: a training reel from a decade ago. Workers in clean uniforms smiled as they carried out procedures, every motion exaggerated to show compliance. But the voices were gone. Only the motions remained, looping endlessly, a pantomime of productivity. When the reel ended, the wall stayed lit with a static image: a slogan, but rewritten in jittering text: <i>YOUR HANDS ARE OURS</i>.
</p>

<p>
The map fragment Sharn had given you labeled this section “Quiet Floors.” In the corner, someone had scrawled a note in grease pencil: <i>watch the walls, not the cams</i>. As if to prove it, one section of paneling trembled when you passed, though no air current stirred. The tremble synced with your heartbeat for three counts, then stopped.
</p>

<p>
Past the conveyors lay an open floor of tiles, each precisely one meter square. The tiles had scuffs but no dust. Every 30 seconds, a light sweep moved across them from one side of the hall to the other, not visible to the naked eye but bright in the reflection of your own sweat. Tala crouched, dragged a gloved finger across the seam of a tile, and showed you: her fingertip glowed faintly green where it had touched.
</p>

<p>
She whispered: “Pattern’s three beats, then sweep. Miss it and you glow for them.” She rubbed her hand clean on a cloth that hissed as if it disliked the task.
</p>

<p>
You moved across with the sweep in your bones, counting rests like musicians count bars. Every step was a gamble with rhythm. When the sweep passed, your eyes filled with afterimages—lines of glyphs that wanted to spell your names but didn’t get them quite right.
</p>

<p>
On the far side of the tiles, a wall of lockers stretched floor to ceiling. Most were sealed, tagged with numbers, but one was ajar. Inside hung a uniform, crisp, folded as though expecting a worker who had stepped out for a break years ago. In the breast pocket was a small ID card. The picture had blurred beyond recognition, but the nameplate remained: <i>KELEN, MARA</i>. Chief Tech. She had signed requisitions you’d glimpsed before in Reclaimer whispers. The card pulsed faintly, in rhythm with the walls.
</p>

<p>
Tala’s face tightened. “Badge closet,” she whispered. “Proof or trap. Both.” Her eyes left the badge and moved to the ceiling, where a panel bulged, then retracted, as though the Factory was considering whether to spit something out.
</p>

<p>
The air here had weight. It carried the taste of old ozone and the suspicion of whispers never finished. Somewhere in the deeper hall, machinery clanged—not rhythm, not song, but the prelude to both. You felt the Factory notice you, and you felt the Factory decide to let you pass. For now.

    <ul>
      <li><b>Surveillance Rhythm:</b> Every 3 rounds, cams sweep. PCs must Hide/Move Silently or use cover. Failures glow faintly (−1 reaction with factions that see it, +1 Accord Optics if logged).</li>
      <li><b>Tile Sweep:</b> Crossing = DEX check or Save vs. Breath Weapon. Fail → PCs marked (green residue). Drones may track later.</li>
      <li><b>Badge Closet:</b> ID card = proof (Accord +1), but also traceable. Carrying it pings Helion Stability clock if scanned.</li>
      <li><b>Environmental Fear:</b> Any PC alone for more than 3 rounds must Save vs. Spells or suffer −1 initiative next encounter (Factory edits their sense of time).</li>
