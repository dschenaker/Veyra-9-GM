  <p class="meta">Briefing: Helion wants calm optics, Zeratek wants a culprit, Reclaimers want their people back, the Accord wants proof. The conduits want to sing.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “When a city gets tired of being believed, it starts telling the truth in other voices.”
  </blockquote>

<h2 class="scene">Descent to the Pulse</h2>
<p>
The access door is not a door so much as a warning. Red paint once shouted AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY across its base, but years of boots have worn the letters into something closer to teeth marks. A faint hum lives in the hinges before you even touch it—like the metal is holding a breath. The Quarter behind you is still full of noise and barter, the faint roar of lives stitched together by necessity. Here, however, the air waits, cool and rehearsed, as though Haven has been anticipating this moment for longer than you’ve existed.
</p>
<p>
When the door slides aside, the world narrows. The false daylight of the dome vanishes almost instantly. What replaces it is not darkness but something worse: light on a ration. Maintenance strips gutter alive one by one, buzzing in unison, each a pale imitation of sunrise. They do not banish the dark so much as carve it into measured slices. The glow stains the walls in intervals like a heartbeat trying to remember its rhythm. Every step forward into this corridor feels like aligning yourself to a pulse older than your choice to walk it.
</p>
<p>
The temperature drops in degrees you can count. Cool air gathers in beads of condensation along the conduits, dripping with a slow percussion that joins the hum in an unwilling duet. The tang of copper rides the air, metallic enough to taste at the back of your tongue. Somewhere deeper, coolant pumps exhale; their sighs echo until the sound becomes less like machinery and more like a sleeper adjusting in their rest. Haven above you is loud, alive, panicked; Haven below whispers, calculating, patient.
</p>
<p>
Lira’s slate glows against your palm. Thin ghost-lines crawl across its surface, outlining the arteries of Haven’s underbelly. Each junction point is annotated with a flickering glyph: <i>PULSE EVENT CONFIRMED</i>. The glyphs stutter as though unwilling to be recorded for long. You realize that what you’re carrying is less a map than a list of warnings dressed as directions. The first mark lies just beyond a switchback corridor, where the maintenance steps descend in narrow spirals. There, the hum grows louder, strong enough to press behind your eyes. It is not quite music, but it arranges itself into patterns your mind insists on recognizing.
</p>
<p>
At the base of the spiral, the corridor opens to a junction. Pools of light spill from weak panels above, and here the air carries the distinct tang of kelp oil. Pipes sweat with condensation, dripping onto the grated floor in irregular beats. Each splash echoes as though the chamber is amplifying them deliberately. For a moment you swear the rhythm is syncing to your heartbeat, adjusting with quiet malice to every change in your breath. The sensation is fleeting—but it is enough to confirm that this descent is no mere walk through infrastructure. Something here knows how to listen back.
</p>
<p>
The hum thickens as you press on. Every bootfall carries its echo forward and returns it slightly altered, a half-beat behind. The effect is subtle, unnerving; it feels less like the corridor is repeating you and more like it is learning you, memorizing the cadence of your steps. If any of you falter, the echo lingers as if waiting for permission to continue without you. The more you notice it, the more difficult it becomes to keep walking.
</p>
<p>
On your left, a rusted service hatch has been sealed shut by welded steel. The marks are recent, the weld lines clean and bright. Someone did not want this hatch opened again. Scratched into the weld with desperate strokes are the words: <i>DON’T TEACH IT</i>. The letters bite into the metal as though carved by someone who was running out of time. The weld still radiates faint heat. Whatever was shut inside—or kept outside—happened less than a day ago.
</p>
<p>
The further you descend, the more the environment resists definition. The air grows damp, not with the honest damp of water, but with the cloying damp of something humid and electric. The conduits themselves no longer seem content to remain conduits. Their casings flex faintly, as though breath passed beneath the plating. The hum stutters here and there, slips into higher registers for a heartbeat, then settles back into rhythm. You have the sense that the machinery is not failing but experimenting. The corridor is not breaking down; it is rehearsing something new.
</p>
<p>
When you reach the first annotated junction on Lira’s slate, the light overhead flickers as though unsure whether to illuminate you or blind you. The panels struggle against each other, never quite in sync, like an orchestra warming up without a conductor. The grating beneath your boots vibrates in pulses you feel in your knees, not your ears. The slate stutters and briefly goes black before returning with a single warning in red: <i>VARIANCE THRESHOLD EXCEEDED</i>. The screen shakes as though the word itself resists being contained.
</p>
<p>
A low sound rolls down the corridor. At first, you think it’s coolant release, the hiss of pressure valves. But it carries resonance, timbre—qualities coolant has no right to carry. It hums in steps: one long, one short, then two in succession. The rhythm repeats, adjusting each time, until it matches the pattern of your breathing. The corridor is no longer a place. It is an audience. The hum waits for your response.
</p>
<p>
You pass a set of maintenance lockers along the wall, their seals unbroken but their surfaces dented inward as though something within had pressed to escape. Faint scratches mar the paint, too small for tools, too deliberate for accident. They trace arcs and dots—notation of some kind. It resembles sheet music if sheet music had been written by someone who only half-understood the idea of notes. The marks carry on across three lockers and stop abruptly at the fourth. The door of that locker bulges outward slightly, its latch bent. A faint pulse of warmth leaks from the seam, rhythmic, alive.
</p>
<p>
If any of you press an ear against the locker, the hum greets you from the other side. It is faint, muffled by metal, but there is no mistaking it. Someone—or something—is practicing song. The notes falter, repeat, falter again. They sound not like a voice but like an echo trying to rehearse what a voice might be. The realization chills deeper than fear: the Choir is not merely speaking through the infrastructure. It is practicing. It is learning.
</p>
<p>
A little further, you find a grating slick with condensation, and there the hum shifts from sound into touch. Every step across it shivers the metal into a vibration that climbs your legs and settles in your teeth. By the time you cross, your jaw aches as though from clenching too long. Your slate registers the pulses as anomalies, sketching jagged red across the map until the screen resembles torn flesh. You shake the image away, but the impression lingers.
</p>
<p>
The final stretch of this corridor is narrow, suffocating. Pipes run along both sides at shoulder height, close enough that their heat fogs your lenses. They breathe in staggered intervals, sighing against your neck, hot and close. The hum beneath your feet no longer feels indifferent; it is deliberate now, a rhythm that presses at the limits of comprehension. The sensation grows until the corridor feels less like a hallway and more like a throat, narrowing as it prepares to speak.
</p>
<p>
When at last you emerge into the junction chamber marked on Lira’s slate, the air shifts. The noise you’ve carried like a burden releases, only to return with more weight. The chamber is circular, its walls scored with old repairs, its ceiling a net of cables and sweat-dark pipes. In its center stands a maintenance platform where three conduits converge. They do not hum in unison. Each beats its own rhythm, and together they weave something dangerously close to a song. The room waits for you, trembling faintly, as if inviting you to listen harder. You realize with certainty that this is only the beginning.
</p>

  <div class="gm-b">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Atmospheric Checks:</b> Characters may attempt WIS or INT checks to parse the hum. Success reveals the rhythm is deliberate, based on prime ratios (1:2, 2:3, 3:5). Failure produces unease and −1 to initiative rolls in next encounter.</li>
      <li><b>Locker Clues:</b> Scratched notation indicates the Choir is <i>practicing human cadence</i>. PCs who record or preserve it gain <i>Accord Leverage +1</i>. Destroying it pleases Reclaimers (+1 trust).</li>
      <li><b>Sealed Hatch:</b> If opened, a blast of stale, variance-heavy air forces a CON save. Inside is abandoned gear (one usable tool or weapon component) but carrying it causes slate interference until cleansed.</li>
      <li><b>Psychological Weight:</b> Characters sensitive to variance (e.g., magic-users, psionics) feel teeth ache and skin crawl. A failed save may cause 1 round of paralysis (fear effect).</li>
      <li><b>Transition:</b> The chamber at the end is the stage-setter. From here, the party either presses deeper into “Silent Evidence” or halts to debate what they’ve just experienced.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">Keep tension slow. This is not yet combat. This is Haven teaching the players that the infrastructure itself has begun to listen.</p>
  </div>
</div>

  <h2 class="scene">Silent Evidence</h2>
<p>
The conduits don’t speak in words, but the silence of people left behind is more articulate than any voice. As you leave the chamber of the first pulse, the corridors bend into tighter angles, lit by panels that no longer seem interested in obeying their circuits. They flare, dim, and sometimes flare again just to prove they can. Your own shadows multiply across the walls, leaning and stretching until they resemble other figures. Once or twice you swear one lags a beat behind, as though reluctant to keep walking.
</p>
<p>
The first sign of absence is ordinary: a crawler squatting on its belly beside a junction, its plating half-removed. Tools lie arranged with the tenderness of a craftsperson who meant to return any minute. Wrenches nested by size, a probe balanced across the curve of a panel, a rag folded into a neat square already stained with grease. Beside them sits a lunch tin, stenciled with a gull over the letters <i>K. OREN</i>. The tin has gone cold. Oil flecks glisten on the bread, as if it was dropped mid-bite. There is no blood. No struggle. Just a life paused as neatly as the rag, waiting for hands that will not return.
</p>
<p>
The hum, however, continues. When you crouch near the crawler, you notice the vibration running through the tools, a fine tremor as if the metal were listening. When you touch them, the tremor grows stronger. If you dare to hold the wrench against the panel, the hum modulates, trying to echo the act of repair. The machine is not broken. It is remembering how repair looks, and practicing.
</p>
<p>
Farther along, the silence sharpens. A sensor bloom juts from the wall, lens cracked by deliberate force. Spiderweb fractures split its glass, each one glittering in your lantern’s glow. But the bloom has not died. Its lens is held in place with fishing line strung through a saint’s medal. The medal spins lazily whenever air moves, scattering the light in trembling halos. Someone tried to blind the corridor. Someone else tried to make it see again. The compromise feels less like repair and more like ritual.
</p>
<p>
The real evidence, however, lies not in the crack but in the cable. A thin Zeratek coupler is spliced into the bloom’s fiber line, tucked with a precision that feels corporate, not desperate. Whatever is happening here is not only the Choir singing. Someone human has been listening, harvesting data. The bloom’s fractured eye may be blind, but its ear is wide open.
</p>
<p>
The corridor beyond narrows, panels stripped bare to expose nerves of cable. Some hang loose, their cut ends splayed like veins ragged by poor surgery. Others have been tied into arcs and circles with chalk marks beneath them. The chalk is crude, a Reclaimer’s hand, but the shapes repeat with mathematical insistence. Circles within circles, arcs crossing at harmonic ratios. A laborer’s sketch of music drawn into the wall itself. A child’s handprint—small, oil-dark—presses over one set of dots. The dots run in a pattern your brain wants to interpret as melody, as if someone tried to write a song in absence of sound.
</p>
<p>
The smell changes. Where before the conduits stank of coolant and dust, here the air carries the sweetness of kelp mixed with something acrid, like insulation burned too long. You realize your shoulders are tense, as though bracing against a shout that hasn’t come yet. Even your boots feel louder. Each step rings across the grated floor in time with the hum, and you cannot tell if you are following its rhythm or if it has learned to follow yours.
</p>
<p>
The silence grows thicker the deeper you go. Not empty—thick, like wool pressed over your ears. Every sound feels dampened but also amplified in memory, as though the room listens twice: once with your ears, once with its own. The tin left behind, the bloom mutilated, the child’s dots—all of it presses against you like witnesses who refuse to speak, but who refuse to leave either. Evidence without testimony, and testimony without trust.
</p>
<p>
At the next junction you discover a wall scrawled with marks layered over each other. Some are crude warnings: <i>NO FURTHER</i>, <i>IT LEARNS</i>, <i>DON’T HUM</i>. Others are not words at all but jagged lines, graphs of variance readings sketched in grease pencil. The paper beneath has been shredded by heat or by hands. One note remains legible: <i>variance spikes match aurora cadence. if this is true, Haven’s dome is a throat.</i> The rest is a blur. Someone tried to understand. They did not succeed—or they did, and vanished when they did.
</p>
<p>
The corridor bends sharply and empties into a wider space where the floor is streaked with drag marks. Rubber soles scuffed in arcs, then a single track of bare feet. The feet are small, slender, slightly pigeon-toed. They walk to the chamber’s center, pause, then double back once as though reconsidering. Then they continue, vanishing into the dark of the next conduit. The prints are recent. Moisture still glistens where the skin met the grate.
</p>
<p>
Your lanterns paint the walls, and you see the child’s dots repeated here, but this time longer, stretching across the bulkhead like a stave of music extended past measure. The dots end abruptly, smudged, as if the hand that drew them shook. Above them, carved with something sharper than chalk, is a sentence: <i>IF YOU READ THIS BACKWARDS, IT IS SINGING TO YOU.</i>
</p>
<p>
Silence presses again. Not passive silence, but demanding silence—the kind that makes your throat itch to fill it, to say anything just to break it. When one of you coughs, the sound bounces back too fast, as if the corridor had rehearsed your cough and was eager to perform it. It is then you realize: the evidence here is not mute. It is practicing. Every absence is an imitation, every silence a rehearsal.

  </div>
</div>

  <h2 class="scene">Where the Power Learns a Mouth</h2>
  <p>
  The corridor widens at Junction F-13C, a round chamber whose purpose used to be obvious: distribute current, vent heat, take orders. It does none of those cleanly now. The heat exchangers breathe unevenly, sighing steam in time to the aurora’s distant shimmer. Three feeder conduits enter the room like arteries that have decided they are also tongues. Where the insulation has split, copper peeks through in lashes. The floor grating hums with a pressure that does not care if it rattles your bones; it wants to <i>tune</i> you.
  </p>
  <p>
  In the center stands a maintenance pylon crowned with a wreath of stripped cable. The wreath is not art. It is function that has learned choreography. Each strand trembles at a different frequency and together they form a halo that thickens the air. Somebody has built a <i>mouth</i> out of power—no ritual circle, no runes, just the brutal poetry of voltage and geometry. If you step too close, your teeth ache. If you speak, your voice doubles, late by half a second, as if something patient is practicing you.
  </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="scene">Saint’s Interruption</h2>
  <p>
  Saint does not call so much as arrive. Her voice threads into your comm at a level lower than background. “Don’t break it yet,” she says, and you can hear the room in her sentence, as if she were already here. “What you are seeing is <i>intent</i> expressed in infrastructure. Someone is teaching the array to hold a note. If you smash the instrument, they will build another. If you name the note, you can make the singer answer.”
  </p>
  <p>
  A beat, the sound of fingers on a ceramic cup. “Record everything. Angle your camera so I can see the lens crowns. If there’s a fourth socket, it means this is modular and they’re deploying them elsewhere. If there are only three, then it’s a prototype or a field test. Either way, keep your hands steady. I need to show someone who thinks she doesn’t have time to be convinced.”

  </div>

  <h2 class="scene">Listening Back</h2>
  <p>
  You do as Saint asks. The camera shakes once—your hand, not fear, you tell yourself—and then steadies. The lenses are indeed in a crown, three equidistant, and between two of them a vacant socket has been carved into the cable with a knife too careful to have been wielded in panic. Someone planned this. Someone stood in this room and measured the distance between harmonics with a tape and a prayer.
  </p>
  <p>
  When you angle lower, the floor tells a different story. Scuffs lead to the south conduit, a trail of rubber soles and one track that is bare foot, slender, slightly pigeon-toed. The track doubles back once, smudges, then resumes. The camera catches a trembling in the grating that does not match the hum; it is a tremolo, a second note waiting like a held breath. If you speak, your voice is echoed again—once by the crown and once by the floor, as if the room were an argument between two choirs.

        <li><b>Install a dampener:</b> Using Arc 3 loot gives temporary quiet (1–2 sessions) but paints the party as competent meddlers; Saint will leverage this in the next briefing.</li>

  <h2 class="scene">When the Lights Forget</h2>
  <p>
  The chamber blinks. Once. Twice. The lights try to be brave a third time and fail. You hear the aurora without seeing it, hear the choir without words. In the darkness the crown whispers against itself, cable on cable, a soft animal sound that refuses to be only mechanical. Your slate backlight paints your palms in blue. Somewhere close by, water talks in a pipe the way a throat prepares to sing.
  </p>
  <p>
  The lights return bruised, all the colors slightly wrong as if the spectrum had been rearranged with a tired hand. The mouth is louder. The vacant socket seems hungrier now that you’ve noticed it. You realize you are no longer audience; you are bait.

        <li><b>If the party lingers:</b> Add a roaming <i>Improvised Strider</i> squad (2) drawn by the resonance, accompanied by a feral utility drone (HD 3) that has “learned” to seek the strongest echo.</li>
        <li><b>If the party moves:</b> Transition immediately toward the sump corridor—the hum resolves into a <i>call-and-response</i> pattern that matches the child’s dot map from earlier.</li>
        <li><b>Foreshadow:</b> A distant metallic laugh. Or just the memory of one.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="scene">Bridge: Into the Mouths</h2>
  <p>
  You take the south conduit. The floor drops by a degree shallow enough to pretend it is not a descent. The sound grows cleaner. It is almost singing now, almost language, almost the human habit of breath before speech. The corridor narrows until your shoulders learn the walls. The crown’s echo thins behind you, replaced by a sharper tone that picks at the insides of your teeth. At the bend ahead, moisture slicks the metal and refracts your lamps into a dozen small suns. When you move, they move, and for a heartbeat you are followed by a crowd of light.
  </p>
  <p>
  The sump opens like a mouth that has learned patience. The grating yawns over a dark pool where condensation gathers and forgets its names. Filaments dangle from the ceiling in frayed skeins, each tipped with the glass coin of a blossom lens. Someone has built a second crown here, but upside-down, suspended, and wired to drip. Every drop strikes the pool with a pitch perfect to the hum. The surface ripples with chords.
  </p>
  <p>
  Lira comes through once, voice degraded by the chorus around you. “Report,” she says, and the word arrives as <i>re-port</i>, split and recombined. Saint says nothing at all. You understand why. No one wants to be heard by a room that answers back.
