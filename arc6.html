  <h1 class="scene">Arc 6 — The Public Forum</h1>
  <p class="meta">Scene 1: Opening Forum. Location: The Spire’s Forum Hall. PCs arrive with evidence and leverage; factions gather with agendas. Crowd mood volatile.</p>

  <p>The Forum Hall was built for optics, not comfort. Tiered seats arced upward into shadows, every bench wired for broadcast. The dome overhead projected a serene aurora, green-white strands that pretended calm. Beneath that lie, five factions gathered: Helion in pressed suits, Zeratek in their polished casual, Compliance in pale uniforms, Reclaimers in patched jackets, and the Accord’s handlers tucked into observation booths where glass reflected more than it revealed.</p>

  <p>Governor Orus Hestrel stood at the central podium. His words had been polished by aides, but the bags beneath his eyes told the truth. “Citizens of Haven, stabilizers, partners,” he began. “We convene tonight to align rumor with fact, to quiet panic with clarity.” The mic orb drifted above him, lenses open like a flower that never closed. Its hum carried into every seat and every home tuned to the feed.</p>

  <p>Captain Lira Veyne remained off to the side, arms folded, her presence a line between factions. Kaelen Drix lounged near the Zeratek cluster, smile sharpened for cameras. Director Sael of Compliance sat so still he looked carved, stylus ready for names. Saint’s voice reached your ear alone, private channel: <i>“Your words set clocks. Say what the dome remembers, not what Hestrel wants it to.”</i></p>

  <p>The crowd was a pressure of bodies and expectation. Some carried Reclaimer armbands, others whispered Malrix slogans, still others clutched their children tighter when the lights flickered with the aurora’s rhythm. One-two-three—<i>dark</i>—four. The pause carried through the hall like a skipped heartbeat.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Atmosphere:</b> Play up optics. Every word echoes on feed. Factions react not just to truth but to <i>how it looks</i>.</li>
        <li><b>PC Leverage:</b> If they still hold the shard/lens, they start with +2 Accord Optics tokens. If surrendered, Helion Stability +1 but PCs have no leverage.</li>
        <li><b>Crowd Mood:</b> Start at Neutral. Bold PC claims shift it (Reclaimer Trust +1 if PCs emphasize worker deaths; Zeratek Favor +1 if they downplay sabotage).</li>
        <li><b>Clock advances:</b> Accord Optics advances if PCs speak against Hestrel’s script. Compliance Control advances if PCs stall or contradict one another.</li>
        <li><b>Transition:</b> End Scene 1 when factions begin crossfire questioning (Scene 2).</li>
