  <h1 class="scene">Arc 6 — The Public Forum</h1>
  <p class="meta">Scene 1: Opening Forum. Location: The Spire’s Forum Hall. PCs arrive with evidence and leverage; factions gather with agendas. Crowd mood volatile.</p>

  <p>The Forum Hall was built for optics, not comfort. Tiered seats arced upward into shadows, every bench wired for broadcast. The dome overhead projected a serene aurora, green-white strands that pretended calm. Beneath that lie, five factions gathered: Helion in pressed suits, Zeratek in their polished casual, Compliance in pale uniforms, Reclaimers in patched jackets, and the Accord’s handlers tucked into observation booths where glass reflected more than it revealed.</p>

  <p>Governor Orus Hestrel stood at the central podium. His words had been polished by aides, but the bags beneath his eyes told the truth. “Citizens of Haven, stabilizers, partners,” he began. “We convene tonight to align rumor with fact, to quiet panic with clarity.” The mic orb drifted above him, lenses open like a flower that never closed. Its hum carried into every seat and every home tuned to the feed.</p>

  <p>Captain Lira Veyne remained off to the side, arms folded, her presence a line between factions. Kaelen Drix lounged near the Zeratek cluster, smile sharpened for cameras. Director Sael of Compliance sat so still he looked carved, stylus ready for names. Saint’s voice reached your ear alone, private channel: <i>“Your words set clocks. Say what the dome remembers, not what Hestrel wants it to.”</i></p>

  <p>The crowd was a pressure of bodies and expectation. Some carried Reclaimer armbands, others whispered Malrix slogans, still others clutched their children tighter when the lights flickered with the aurora’s rhythm. One-two-three—<i>dark</i>—four. The pause carried through the hall like a skipped heartbeat.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Atmosphere:</b> Play up optics. Every word echoes on feed. Factions react not just to truth but to <i>how it looks</i>.</li>
        <li><b>PC Leverage:</b> If they still hold the shard/lens, they start with +2 Accord Optics tokens. If surrendered, Helion Stability +1 but PCs have no leverage.</li>
        <li><b>Crowd Mood:</b> Start at Neutral. Bold PC claims shift it (Reclaimer Trust +1 if PCs emphasize worker deaths; Zeratek Favor +1 if they downplay sabotage).</li>
        <li><b>Clock advances:</b> Accord Optics advances if PCs speak against Hestrel’s script. Compliance Control advances if PCs stall or contradict one another.</li>
        <li><b>Transition:</b> End Scene 1 when factions begin crossfire questioning (Scene 2).</li>

<h2 class="scene" id="arc6-faction-crossfire">Faction Crossfire — Truth Under Lights</h2>

<p>The Forum Hall had no corners to hide in. The podium’s glow spilled in every direction, forcing words to travel clean or not at all. Hestrel tried to keep hold of it, eyes darting between his prompter and the live graph of crowd sentiment scrolling overhead. For a few minutes, the lines behaved. Then they broke.</p>

<p>Kaelen Drix stood. Not loud, not brash—calm enough to make cameras lean in. “Governor,” he said, “with respect, Haven cannot pretend sabotage is systemic. Zeratek acknowledges legacy units have vulnerabilities. But we must not incite panic by exaggerating risk. Legacy recalls are routine. Stabilizers,” his smile flicked to you, “brought us proof. But proof requires interpretation.”</p>

<p>The crowd rippled. Reclaimer armbands flashed. Serin Vael shouted from the second tier: “Interpret this—three dead under your arrays, Drix! You sell us parts that sing before they kill us!” Her words carried like a spark into dry hay. Chants started, rough and uneven: <i>RECLAIM! RECLAIM!</i></p>

<p>Director Sael waited for silence, then folded his hands. “Fear is itself contagion. Compliance urges calm. Families must not endanger one another with rumor. Variances are monitored, screenings offered. Safety is not a slogan—it is policy.” His stylus tapped the tablet, names scrolling into hidden ledgers.</p>

<p>Hestrel cleared his throat too late. “Citizens, please—this forum must remain orderly—” The mic orb hummed louder to cover him.</p>

<p><i>Saint’s whisper cut your ear: “Order is their weapon. Disorder is your proof. Decide who bleeds first—optics, truth, or silence.”</i></p>

<p>Veyne stepped forward, jaw set. “The stabilizers saw more than recalls and policies. They saw variance routes rerouted through Zeratek panels. They saw families pulled by Compliance without return. They carried proof here. Let them speak.” Her words struck clean, without script. The crowd surged in volume, a tide hungry for something unedited.</p>

<p>Eyes turned to you. Every lens widened. Every faction leaned forward to snatch what you offered. In the air above, the graph quivered, waiting for direction.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>If you raise the shard/lens</b>, the hall gasps. Blue-white pulse reflected across every surface. Drix paled under it, Sael scribbled faster, Hestrel looked anywhere but at the light. The crowd cheered—or recoiled, depending on your framing.</p>

<p><b>If you withhold</b>, Saint murmured approval. “Leverage intact.” The factions fought each other harder, each trying to fill the silence with their spin.</p>

<p>Either way, the crossfire began.</p>

<p>— Drix accused Reclaimers of sabotage to avoid liability.  
— Serin called Helion cowards for hiding behind reports.  
— Sael offered screenings for anyone “exposed to anomalies.”  
— Hestrel begged for unity, his voice swallowed by chants.  
— Saint pushed in your ear: “Name a liar. The crowd will follow.”</p>

<p>The lights flickered to the child’s rhythm. One-two-three—<i>dark</i>—four. On the <i>dark</i>, every mic went dead. The hall heard its own breathing, and the pause stretched too long. Then the lights flared back, and every faction spoke at once.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Structure:</b> Treat this as social combat. Each round, a faction presses an agenda. PCs can support, oppose, or reframe. Roll CHA/Reaction or WIS/Insight checks.</li>
      <li><b>Leverage:</b> Showing shard/lens gives +2 on Accord Optics rolls but +1 on Zeratek’s <b>Legacy Recall</b> clock. Withholding avoids Recall but loses immediate impact.</li>
      <li><b>Crowd Mood:</b> If PCs emphasize deaths → Reclaimer Trust +1. If they stress safety policy → Compliance Control +1. If they push Helion optics → Helion Stability +1.</li>
      <li><b>Saint’s push:</b> If PCs call someone a liar on record, Accord Optics +1, but target faction fills 1 segment of their clock in retaliation.</li>
      <li><b>Risk:</b> Each time lights pulse dark, save vs. Spells or lose words mid-sentence. If failed, Compliance seizes narrative: +1 Compliance Control.</li>
      <li><b>Escalation:</b> End scene when crowd mood tips majority in one direction OR when 2 clocks advance simultaneously. This triggers Scene 3 (The Breach).</li>

<h2 class="scene" id="arc6-scene2">Scene 2 — Faction Crossfire: Truth Under Lights</h2>

<p>The Forum Hall had no corners to hide in. The podium’s glow spilled in every direction, forcing words to travel clean or not at all. For a few minutes Governor Hestrel held the room by prompter and graph; then the lines broke.</p>

<p><b>Kaelen Drix</b> rose with a measured smile. “Governor, with respect… Haven cannot pretend sabotage is systemic. Zeratek acknowledges legacy vulnerabilities, but interpretation matters.” Cameras leaned in.</p>

<p>From the tiers, <b>Serin Vael</b> cut back: “Interpret this—three dead under your arrays!” Reclaimer armbands flashed; the first chant formed, rough and hungry: <i>RE-CLAIM!</i></p>

<p><b>Director Sael</b> folded his hands. “Fear is contagion. Compliance urges calm. Screenings are available; rumor is harm.” His stylus ticked unseen ledgers.</p>

<p>Hestrel’s mic orb hummed louder, trying to cover a wobble. Above, the sentiment graph quivered, waiting for a direction.</p>

<p><i>Saint, private channel:</i> “Order is their weapon. Disorder is your proof. Decide who bleeds first—optics, truth, or silence.”</p>

<p><b>Captain Veyne</b> stepped into the light. “The stabilizers brought proof of rerouted variance and vanished families. Let them speak.” The room tipped toward you; every lens widened.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>If you raise the shard/lens:</b> blue-white pulse washes the hall; Drix pales, Sael writes faster, Hestrel looks away. Cheers or gasps—your framing decides.</p>
<p><b>If you withhold:</b> Saint approves—leverage intact—but the factions claw harder to fill the silence.</p>

<p>Either way the crossfire starts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drix floats “Reclaimer sabotage” to dodge liability.</li>
  <li>Serin brands Helion cowards hiding behind reports.</li>
  <li>Sael offers “exposure screenings” and starts taking names.</li>
  <li>Hestrel begs unity; chants fold over him.</li>
  <li>Saint murmurs: “Name a liar. The crowd will follow.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The lights flicker to a child’s rhythm—one two three <i>dark</i> four. On the <i>dark</i>, mics die. The hall hears itself breathing. Then power snaps back and everyone speaks at once.</p>
